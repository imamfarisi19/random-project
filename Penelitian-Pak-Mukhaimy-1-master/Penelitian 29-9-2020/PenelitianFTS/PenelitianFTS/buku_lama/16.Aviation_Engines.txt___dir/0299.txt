The oil pump assembly comprises a pair of plunger pumps which draw oil
from a separate outside pump, and constructed integrally with it is a
gear pump which delivers the oil under about 60 pound pressure through a
set of copper pipes in the base to the main bearings. The plunger oil
pump shows great refinement of detail. A worm wheel and two eccentrics
are machined up out of one piece and serve to operate the plungers.
