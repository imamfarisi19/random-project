Another method for finding the drift is _D_ = _K_ × _AV_^{2}, when we
take the drift again so as to be greatest.

The second "resistance" is the total head resistance of the machine, at
its maximum velocity. And the third is the thrust for climbing. The
horse-power for climbing can be found out in two different ways. I first
propose to deal with the method, where we find out the actual
horse-power wanted for a certain climbing speed to our machine, where

climbing speed/sec. × _W_
H.P. = ---------------------------
550

In this case we know already the horse-power for climbing, and we can
proceed with our calculation.

With the other method we shall find out the "thrust" in pounds or
kilograms wanted for climbing and add it to drift and total head
resistance, and we shall have the total "thrust" of our machine and we
shall denote it with _T_, while thrust for climbing shall be _T_{c}_.

The following calculation is at our service to find out

_V_{c}_ × _W_
this thrust for climbing --------------- = H.P.,
550

H.P. × 550
thence _V_{c}_ = ------------                                      (1)
_W_

_T_{c}_ × _V_
H.P. = --------------, then from
550

_T_{c}_ × _V_
--------------- × 550
550                  _T_{c}_ × _V_
(1) _V_{c}_ = ----------------------- = ---------------, thence,
_W_                    _W_

_V_{c}_ × _W_
T_{c} = ---------------.
_V_

Whether _T_ means drifts, head resistance and thrust for climbing, or
drift and head resistance only, the following calculation is the same,
only in the latter case, of course, we must add the horse-power required
for climbing to the result to obtain the total horse-power.

Now, when we know the total thrust, we shall find the horse-power in the
following manner:

_Pr_2[pi]_R_
We know that the H.P. = -------------- in kilograms, or in
75 × 60

_Pr_2[pi]_R_
English measure, H.P. = -------------- (Fig. 1, B)
33,000

where _P_ = pressure in klgs. or lbs.
_r_ = radius on which _P_ is acting.
_R_ = Revolution/min.
