|                      TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES                        |
|                                                                 |
| General remarks:                                                |
|   There are some differences in wording between the Table of    |
|   Contents, the lists of sections per chapter, and the actual   |
|   section titles. Their meaning is clear, and they have been    |
|   left as they were in the original work.                       |
|   Page 56, table: Fig. 8 in the first column does not refer to  |
|   Fig. 8 in this work.                                          |
|   The original work does not have a Figure 89.                  |
|   Page 303, table: it is uncertain what "free with kerosene"    |
|   means, there may be a word omitted.                           |
|   Page 544, entirely censored. It is not clear what this page   |
|   originally contained (possibly a table), since text and       |
|   numbering of illustrations are uninterrupted. The text        |
|   "CENSORED" has been moved to after the first paragraph of the |
|   section on Mercedes Engines.                                  |
|   The List of Illustrations does not occur in the original work.|
|                                                                 |
| Changes made:                                                   |
|   The text of the original work (including inconsistencies in   |
|   accents, spelling, hyphenation and lay-out, and differences   |
|   between the main text, illustrations and advertisements) has  |
|   been followed, except when listed below. Only some minor      |
|   obvious typographical errors have been corrected silently.    |
|   Where the author used x for multiplication, this has been     |
|   replaced by × in the body of the text (not in the             |
|   advertisements or illustrations).                             |
|   The illustrations have been moved so as not to disrupt the    |
|   flow of the text.                                             |
|   Engine and aircraft types are not always named consistently in|
|   the original; Curtiss engine O X 2, OX-2 and 0X2 have all     |
|   been changed to OX-2, Curtiss aircraft JN4 and JN-4 to JN-4.  |
|   Multi-page tables: repeated headings have been removed, and   |
|   the tables treated as one consecutive table.                  |
|   Page 22: "The product of" has been moved into the first       |
|   formula.                                                      |
|   Page 25: "When B × r = M" changed to "When P × r = M".        |
|   Page 74: ".225 ÷ 775 = .2905" changed to ".225 ÷ .775 =       |
|   .2905".                                                       |
|   Page 137 (caption): "Bavary" changed to "Baverey" as          |
|   elsewhere.                                                    |

|   common".                                                      |

|   Page 324: "Rhone" changed to "Le Rhone" as elsewhere.         |
