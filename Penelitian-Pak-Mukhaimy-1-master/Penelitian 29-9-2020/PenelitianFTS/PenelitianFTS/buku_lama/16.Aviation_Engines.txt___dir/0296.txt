The cylinder sizes of six-cylinder aviation motors which have been built
by Mercedes are

Bore      Stroke    Horse-power
105 mm.    140 mm.       100
120 mm.    140 mm.       135
140 mm.    150 mm.       150
140 mm.    160 mm.       160

The largest of these motors has recently had its horse-power increased
to 176 at 1450 R. P. M. This general design of motor has been the
foundation for a great many other aviation motor designs, some of which
have proved very successful but none of which is equal to the original.
Among the motors which follow more or less closely the scheme of design
and arrangement are the Hall-Scott, the Wisconsin motor, the Renault
water-cooled, the Packard, the Christofferson and the Rolls-Royce. Each
of these motors show considerable variation in detail. The Rolls-Royce
and Renault are the only ones who have used the steel cylinder with the
steel jacket. The Wisconsin motor uses an aluminum cylinder with a
hardened steel liner and cast-iron valve seats. The Christofferson has
somewhat similar design to the Wisconsin with the exception that the
valve seats are threaded into the aluminum jacket and the cylinder head
has a blank end which is secured to the aluminum casting by means of the
valve seat pieces. The Rolls-Royce motors show small differences in
details of design in cylinder head and cam-shaft housing from the
Mercedes on which it has taken out patents, not only abroad but in this
country.


THE BENZ MOTOR

In the Kaiser prize contest for aviation motors a four-cylinder Benz
motor of 130 by 180 mm. won first prize, developing 103 B. H. P. at 1290
R. P. M. The fuel consumption was 210 grams per horse-power hour. Total
weight of the motor was 153 kilograms. The oil consumption was .02 of a
kilogram per horse-power hour. This motor was afterward expanded into a
six-cylinder design and three different sizes were built.

The accompanying table gives some of the details of weight, horse-power,
etc.
