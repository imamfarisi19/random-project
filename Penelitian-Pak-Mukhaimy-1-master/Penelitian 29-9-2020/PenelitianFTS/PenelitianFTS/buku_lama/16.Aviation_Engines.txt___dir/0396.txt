=Everyday Engineering=

A monthly magazine devoted to practical mechanics for everyday men. Its
aim is to popularize engineering as a science, teaching the elements of
applied mechanics and electricity in a straightforward and
understandable manner. The magazine maintains its own experimental
laboratory where the devices described in articles submitted to the
Editor are first tried out and tested before they are published. This
important innovation places the standard of the published material very
high, and it insures accuracy and dependability.

The magazine is the only one in this country that specializes in
practical model building. Articles in past issues have given
comprehensive designs for many model boats, including submarines and
chasers, model steam and gasoline engines, electric motors and
generators, etc., etc. This feature is a permanent one in this magazine.

Another popular department is that devoted to automobiles and airplanes.
Care, maintenance, and operation receive full and authoritative
treatment. Every article is written from the practical, everyday man,
standpoint rather than from that of the professional.

The magazine entertains while it instructs. It is a journal of
practical, dependable information given in such a style that it may be
readily assimilated and applied by the man with little or no technical
training. The aim is to place before the man who leans toward practical
mechanics, a series of concise, crisp, readable talks on what is going
on and _how it is done_. These articles are profusely illustrated with
clear, snappy photographs, specially posed to illustrate the subject in
the magazine's own studio by its own staff of technically-trained
illustrators and editors.
