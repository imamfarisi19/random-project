The internal-combustion system of creating power is comparatively new in
practice, and is but just settling into definite shape by repeated
trials and modification of details, so as to give somewhat reliable data
as to what may be expected from the rival of the steam-engine as a prime
mover. For small powers, the gas, gasoline, and petroleum-oil engines
are forging ahead at a rapid rate, filling the thousand wants of
manufacture and business for a power that does not require expensive
care, that is perfectly safe at all times, that can be used in any place
in the wide world to which its concentrated fuel can be conveyed, and
that has eliminated the constant handling of crude fuel and water.


REQUISITES FOR BEST POWER EFFECT

The utilization of heat in a gas-engine is mainly due to the manner in
which the products entering into combustion are distributed in relation
to the movement of the piston. The investigation of the foremost
exponent of the theory of the explosive motor was prophetic in
consideration of the later realization of the best conditions under
which these motors can be made to meet the requirements of economy and
practicability. As early as 1862, Beau de Rocha announced, in regard to
the coming power, that four requisites were the basis of operation for
economy and best effect. 1. The greatest possible cylinder volume with
the least possible cooling surface. 2. The greatest possible rapidity of
expansion. Hence, _high speed_. 3. The greatest possible expansion.
_Long stroke._ 4. The greatest possible pressure at the commencement of
expansion. _High compression._
