_First Method:_

1. Designate one cylinder as cylinder No. 1.

2. Turn the crank-shaft until the piston in cylinder No. 1 is in the
position where the fully advanced spark is desired to occur.

3. Remove the cover from the distributor block and turn the armature
shaft in the direction of rotation of the magneto until the distributor
finger-brush comes into such a position that this brush makes contact
with the segment which is connected to the cable terminal marked "1."
This is either one of the two bottom segments, depending upon the
direction of rotation.

4. Place the cam housing in extreme advance, i.e., turn the cam housing
until it stops, in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation
of the armature. With the cam housing in this position, open the cover.

5. With the armature in the approximate position as described in "3,"
turn the armature slightly in either direction to such a point that the
platinum points of the magneto interrupter will just begin to open at
the end of the cam, adjacent to the fibre lever on the interrupter.

6. With this exact position of the armature, fix the magneto to the
driving member of the engine.


_Second Method:_

1. Designate one cylinder as cylinder No. 1.

2. Turn the crank-shaft until the piston in cylinder No. 1 is in the
position at which the fully retarded spark is desired to occur.

3. Same as No. 3 under First Method.

4. Place the cam housing in extreme retard, i.e., turn the cam housing
until it stops, in the same direction as the direction of rotation of
the armature. With the cam housing in this position, open the cover.

5. Same as No. 5 under First Method.

6. Same as No. 6 under First Method.


WIRING THE MAGNETO

The wiring of the magneto is clearly shown by wiring diagram.

First determine the sequence of firing for the cylinders and then
connect the cables to the spark plug in the cylinders in proper
sequence, beginning with cylinder No. 1 marked on the distributor block.
