FACTORS GOVERNING ECONOMY

In view of the experiments in this direction, it clearly shows that in
practical work, to obtain the greatest economy per effective brake
horse-power, it is necessary: 1st. To transform the heat into work with
the greatest rapidity mechanically allowable. This means high piston
speed. 2d. To have high initial compression. 3d. To reduce the duration
of contact between the hot gases and the cylinder walls to the smallest
amount possible; which means short stroke and quick speed, with a
spherical cylinder head. 4th. To adjust the temperature of the jacket
water to obtain the most economical output of actual power. This means
water-tanks or water-coils, with air-cooling surfaces suitable and
adjustable to the most economical requirement of the engine, which by
late trials requires the jacket water to be discharged at about 200Â° F.
5th. To reduce the wall surface of the clearance space or combustion
chamber to the smallest possible area, in proportion to its required
volume. This lessens the loss of the heat of combustion by exposure to a
large surface, and allows of a higher mean wall temperature to
facilitate the heat of compression.
