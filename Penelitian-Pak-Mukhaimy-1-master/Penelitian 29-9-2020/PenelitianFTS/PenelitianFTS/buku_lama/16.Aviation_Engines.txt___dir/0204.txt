DEFECTS IN ELECTRICAL SYSTEM COMPONENTS

To further simplify the location of electrical system faults it is
thought desirable to outline the defects that can be present in the
various parts of the individual devices comprising the ignition system.
If an airplane engine is provided with magneto ignition solely, as most
engines are at the present time, no attention need be paid to such items
as storage or dry batteries, timer or induction coil. There seems to be
some development in the direction of battery ignition so it has been
considered desirable to include components of these systems as well as
the almost universally used magneto group. Spark-plugs, wiring and
switches are needed with either system.


SPARK-PLUGS

DEFECT                       TROUBLE CAUSED          REMEDY
Insulation cracked.          Plug inoperative.       New insulation.
Insulation oil soaked.       Cylinder misfires.      Clean.
Carbon deposits.             Short circuited spark.  Remove.
Insulator loose.             Cylinder misfires.      Tighten.
Gasket broken.               Gas leaks by.           New gasket.
Electrode loose on shell.    Cylinder misfires.      Tighten.
Wire loose in insulator.     Cylinder misfires.      Tighten.
Air gap too close.           Short circuits spark.   Set correctly.
Air gap too wide.            Spark will not jump.    Set points 1/32"
apart.
Loose terminal.              Cylinder may misfire.   Tighten.
Plug loose in cylinder.      Gas leaks.              Tighten.
Mica insulation oil soaked.  Short circuits spark.   Replace.
