The explosive pressure varies to a considerable amount in proportion to
the compression pressure by the difference in fuel value and the
proportions of air mixtures, so that for good illuminating gas the
explosive pressure may be from 2.5 to 4 times the compression pressure.
For natural gas 3 to 4.5, for gasoline 3 to 5, for producer-gas 2 to 3,
and for kerosene by injection 3 to 6.

The compression temperatures, although well known and easily computed
from a known normal temperature of the explosive mixture, are subject to
the effect of the uncertain temperature of the gases of the previous
explosion remaining in the cylinder, the temperature of its walls, and
the relative volume of the charge, whether full or scant; which are
terms too variable to make any computations reliable or available.

For the theoretical compression temperatures from a known normal
temperature, we append a table of the rise in temperature for the
compression pressures in the following table:

CHART FOR DETERMINING COMPRESSION PRESSURES

A very useful chart (Fig. 16) for determining compression pressures in
gasoline-engine cylinders for various ratios of compression space to
total cylinder volume is given by P. S. Tice, and described in the
Chilton Automobile Directory by the originator as follows:

[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Chart Showing Relation Between Compression
Volume and Pressure.]

It is many times desirable to have at hand a convenient means for at
once determining with accuracy what the compression pressure will be in
a gasoline-engine cylinder, the relationship between the volume of the
compression space and the total cylinder volume or that swept by the
piston being known. The curve at Fig. 16 is offered as such a means. It
is based on empirical data gathered from upward of two dozen modern
automobile engines and represents what may be taken to be the results as
found in practice. It is usual for the designer to find compression
pressure values, knowing the volumes from the equation
