Now the power on the circumference of the propeller will be reduced by
its radius, so it will be _M_/_r_ = _p_. A part of _p_ will be used for
counteracting the air and bearing friction, so that the total power on
the circumference of the propeller will be (_M_/_r_) × [eta] = _p_ where
[eta] is the mechanical efficiency of the propeller. Now

[eta]
--------------- = _T_, where [alpha] is taken on the tip of the
_tan_ [alpha]

propeller.

I take [alpha] at the tip, but it can be taken, of course, at any point,
but then in equation _p_ = _M_/_r_, _r_ must be taken only up to this
point, and not the whole radius; but it is more comfortable to take it
at the tip, as

_tan_ [alpha] = ---------- (Fig. 1, C).

Now we can write up the equation of the thrust:

_R r tan [alpha]_                          _R r tan [alpha]_

_T_ × _R_ × _r tan_ [alpha]
thence H.P. = -----------------------------, or in English measure

_T_ × _R_ × _r tan_ [alpha]
-----------------------------.

The computations and formulæ given are of most value to the student
engineer rather than matters of general interest, but are given so that
a general idea may be secured of how airplane design influences power
needed to secure sustained flight. It will be apparent that the
resistance of an airplane depends upon numerous considerations of design
which require considerable research in aerodynamics to determine
accurately. It is obvious that the more resistance there is, the more
power needed to fly at a given speed. Light monoplanes have been flown
with as little as 15 horse-power for short distances, but most planes
now built use engines of 100 horse-power or more. Giant airplanes have
been constructed having 2,000 horse-power distributed in four power
units. The amount of power provided for an airplane of given design
varies widely as many conditions govern this, but it will range from
approximately one horse-power to each 8 pounds weight in the case of
very light, fast machines to one horse-power to 15 or 18 pounds of the
total weight in the case of medium speed machines. The development in
airplane and power plant design is so rapid, however, that the figures
given can be considered only in the light of general averages rather
than being typical of current practice.
