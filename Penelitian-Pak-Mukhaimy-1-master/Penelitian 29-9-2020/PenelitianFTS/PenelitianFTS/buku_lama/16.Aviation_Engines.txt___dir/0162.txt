CONSTRUCTIONAL DETAILS OF PISTONS

The piston is one of the most important parts of the gasoline motor
inasmuch as it is the reciprocating member that receives the impact of
the explosion and which transforms the power obtained by the combustion
of gas to mechanical motion by means of the connecting rod to which it
is attached. The piston is one of the simplest elements of the motor,
and it is one component which does not vary much in form in different
types of motors. The piston is a cylindrical member provided with a
series of grooves in which packing rings are placed on the outside and
two bosses which serve to hold the wrist pin in its interior. It is
usually made of cast iron or aluminum, though in some motors where
extreme lightness is desired, such as those used for aÃ«ronautic work, it
may be made of steel. The use of the more resisting material enables the
engineer to use lighter sections where it is important that the weight
of this member be kept as low as possible consistent with strength.
