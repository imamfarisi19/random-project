The expansion of a gas 1/273 of its volume for every degree Centigrade,
added to its temperature, is equal to the decimal .00366, the
coefficient of expansion for Centigrade units. To any given volume of a
gas, its expansion may be computed by multiplying the coefficient by
the number of degrees, and by reversing the process the degree of
acquired heat may be obtained approximately. These methods are not
strictly in conformity with the absolute mathematical formula, because
there is a small increase in the increment of expansion of a dry gas,
and there is also a slight difference in the increment of expansion due
to moisture in the atmosphere and to the vapor of water formed by the
union of the hydrogen and oxygen in the combustion chamber of explosive
engines.


TEMPERATURE COMPUTATIONS

The ratio of expansion on the Fahrenheit scale is derived from the
absolute temperature below the freezing-point of water (32°) to
correspond with the Centigrade scale; therefore 1/492.66 = .0020297, the
ratio of expansion from 32° for each degree rise in temperature on the
Fahrenheit scale. As an example, if the temperature of any volume of air
or gas at constant volume is raised, say from 60° to 2000° F., the
increase in temperature will be 1940°. The ratio will be 1/520.66 =
.0019206. Then by the formula:

Ratio × acquired temp. × initial pressure = the gauge pressure; and
.0019206 × 1940° × 14.7 = 54.77 lbs.

By another formula, a convenient ratio is obtained by (absolute
pressure)/(absolute temp.) or 14.7/520.66 = .028233; then, using the
difference of temperature as before, .028233 × 1940° = 54.77 lbs.
pressure.

By another formula, leaving out a small increment due to specific heat
at high temperatures:

Atmospheric pressure × absolute temp. + acquired temp.
I. -------------------------------------------------------- =
Absolute temp. + initial temp.

absolute pressure due to the acquired temperature, from which the
atmospheric pressure is deducted for the gauge pressure. Using the
foregoing example, we have (14.7 × 460.66° + 2000°)/(460.66 + 60°) =
69.47 - 14.7 = 54.77, the gauge pressure, 460.66 being the absolute
temperature for zero Fahrenheit.
