In building up the core a small section of washers, I, is built up
before the mica insulating tube D is placed on. This construction gives
a better support to section I. Baffle plate O is bored out to allow the
electrode J to pass through, and the clearance between baffle plate and
electrode is made larger than the width of the gap between the firing
points, so that there is no danger of the spark jumping from the
electrode to the baffle plate.

This plug will be furnished either with or without the finned portion,
to meet individual requirements. The manufacturers lay special stress
upon the simplicity of construction and upon the method of clamping,
which is claimed to make the plug absolutely gas-tight.

WHY LUBRICATION IS NECESSARY

The importance of minimizing friction at the various bearing surfaces of
machines to secure mechanical efficiency is fully recognized by all
mechanics, and proper lubricity of all parts of the mechanism is a very
essential factor upon which the durability and successful operation of
the motor car power plant depends. All of the moving members of the
engine which are in contact with other portions, whether the motion is
continuous or intermittent, of high or low velocity, or of rectilinear
or continued rotary nature, should be provided with an adequate supply
of oil. No other assemblage of mechanism is operated under conditions
which are so much to its disadvantage as the motor car, and the tendency
is toward a simplification of oiling methods so that the supply will be
ample and automatically applied to the points needing it.
