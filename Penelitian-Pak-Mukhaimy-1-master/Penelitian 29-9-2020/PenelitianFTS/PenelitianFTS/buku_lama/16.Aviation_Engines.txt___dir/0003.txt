PREFACE


In presenting this treatise on "Aviation Engines," the writer realizes
that the rapidly developing art makes it difficult to outline all latest
forms or describe all current engineering practice. This exposition has
been prepared primarily for instruction purposes and is adapted for men
in the Aviation Section, Signal Corps, and students who wish to become
aviators or aviation mechanicians. Every effort has been made to have
the engineering information accurate, but owing to the diversity of
authorities consulted and use of data translated from foreign language
periodicals, it is expected that some slight errors will be present. The
writer wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to such firms as the
Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Co., Hall-Scott Company, Thomas-Morse
Aircraft Corporation and General Vehicle Company for photographs and
helpful descriptive matter. Special attention has been paid to
instructions on tool equipment, use of tools, trouble "shooting" and
engine repairs, as it is on these points that the average aviation
student is weakest. Only such theoretical consideration of
thermo-dynamics as was deemed absolutely necessary to secure a proper
understanding of engine action after consulting several instructors is
included, the writer's efforts having been confined to the preparation
of a practical series of instructions that would be of the greatest
value to those who need a diversified knowledge of internal-combustion
engine operation and repair, and who must acquire it quickly. The
engines described and illustrated are all practical forms that have been
fitted to airplanes capable of making flights and may be considered
fairly representative of the present state of the art.
