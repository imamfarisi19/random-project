Brief note is also made of the remedies for the restoration of the
defective part or condition. It is apparent that a table of this
character is intended merely as a guide, and it is a compilation of
practically all the known troubles that may materialize in gas-engine
operation. While most of the defects outlined are common enough to
warrant suspicion, they will never exist in an engine all at the same
time, and it will be necessary to make a systematic search for such of
those as exist.

To use the list advantageously, it is necessary to know one main trouble
easily recognized. For example, if the power plant is noisy, look for
the possible troubles under the head of Noisy Operation; if it lacks
capacity, the derangement will undoubtedly be found under the head of
Lost Power. It is assumed in all cases that the trouble exists in the
power plant or its components, and not in the auxiliary members of the
ignition, carburetion, lubrication, or cooling systems. The novice and
student will readily recognize the parts of the average aviation engine
by referring to the very complete and clearly lettered illustrations of
mechanism given in many parts of this treatise.
