Long John even got rid of two out of the six
or seven I had already engaged.  He showed me in a
moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water
swabs we had to fear in an adventure of
importance.

I am in the most magnificent health and
spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like a tree,
yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old
tarpaulins tramping round the capstan.  Seaward,
ho!  Hang the treasure!  It's the glory of the sea
that has turned my head.  So now, Livesey, come
post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.

Let young Hawkins go at once to see his
mother, with Redruth for a guard; and then both
come full speed to Bristol.

Postscript--I did not tell you that Blandly,
who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if
we don't turn up by the end of August, had found
an admirable fellow for sailing master--a stiff
man, which I regret, but in all other respects a
treasure.  Long John Silver unearthed a very
competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow.  I
have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things
shall go man-o'-war fashion on board the good ship
HISPANIOLA.

I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of
substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has
a banker's account, which has never been
overdrawn.  He leaves his wife to manage the inn;
and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old
bachelors like you and I may be excused for
guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the
health, that sends him back to roving.

P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night with his
mother.

You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half
beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old
Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the
under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such
was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law
among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even
to grumble.
