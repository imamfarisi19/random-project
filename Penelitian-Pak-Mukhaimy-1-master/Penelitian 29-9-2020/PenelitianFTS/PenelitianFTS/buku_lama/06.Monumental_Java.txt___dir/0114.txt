The exact date of the birth of the _chandi_ Mendoot is unknown but
there are reasons for believing that it was built shortly after the
_chandi_ Boro Budoor, at some time between 700 and 850 Saka (778 and 928
of the Christian era), in the glorious period of Javanese architecture
to which we owe also the Prambanan group, the _chandis_ Kalasan, Sewu
and whatever is of the best in the island. There are additional reasons
for believing that the splendour loving prince who ordered the Boro
Budoor to be raised and under whose reign the work on that stupendous
monument was begun, founded the Mendoot too as a mausoleum to perpetuate
his memory, and that his ashes were deposited in the royal tomb of his
own designing before its completion. If so, he was one of the most
prolific and liberal builders we have cognisance of; but his memory
is nameless and all we know of him personally, besides the imposing
evidence to his Augustan disposition contained in the superb structures
he left, rests upon two pieces of sculpture at the entrance to the
inner chamber of the mortuary chapel, if such it be, which represent a
royal couple with a round dozen of children, just as we find in some
old western churches the carved or painted images of their foundersâ€™
families.[128] We are perhaps indebted for the preservation of these
suggestive reliefs to the circumstance of the _chandi_ Mendoot having
been covered, hidden from view during centuries and to a certain extent
protected against sacrilegious hands by volcanic sand, earth and
vegetation. Almost forgotten, its slumbers were, however, not wholly
undisturbed for, when Resident Hartman, his curiosity being excited by
wild tales, began to clear it in 1836, he found that treasure-seekers,
out for plunder, had pierced the wall above the porch and that by way
of consolation or out of vexation at missing the untold wealth reported
to be buried inside, they had carried off or smashed the smaller, free
standing statuary. The process of cleaning up rather stimulated than
prevented new outrages: stripped of its covering of detritus, which
had shielded it at least against petty, casual pilfering, the _chandi_
Mendoot excited by its helpless beauty the most injurious enthusiasm.
Fortunately, the statues which formed its chief attraction were too big
for the attentions of the long-fingered gentry whose peculiar methods in
dealing with native art strongly needed but never experienced repression
by the local authorities.
