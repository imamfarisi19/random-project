as a title conferred in polite address on persons of lower birth.

[116] _Alocasia macrorrhiza Schott_ of the _Aracaceae_ family; the
leaf, which once betokened dignity, is still used to protect the head
and upper part of the body against rain; other parts of the plant serve
sometimes as food.

[117] The pit there discovered makes the monastic character more than
doubtful while it accentuates the syncretism in which also the ornament
of these _chandis_ does not differ from all Central Javanese religious
structures of the period, except those on the Diëng plateau.

CHAPTER VIII

THE APPROACH TO THE BORO BUDOOR

The goodly works, and stones of rich assay,
Cast into sundry shapes by wondrous skill,
That like on earth no where I reckon may;

EDMUND SPENSER, _Faerie Queene_, Canto X.


Among the ancient monuments of Insulinde[125] the _chandi_ Boro
Budoor stands _facile princeps_. Situated in the Kadu, it is easily
reached from Jogjakarta, about twenty-five miles, or from Magelang,
about eighteen miles distant, by carriage or, still more easily, by
taking the steam-tram which connects those two provincial capitals and
leaving the cars at Moontilan where an enterprising Chinaman provides
vehicles, at short notice, for the rest of the journey via the _chandi_
Mendoot on the left bank of the Ello, just above its confluence with
the Progo. No better approach to the most consummate achievement of
Buddhist architecture in the island or in the whole world, can be
imagined than this one, which leads past the smaller but scarcely less
nobly conceived and conscientiously executed temple, a commensurate
introduction to the wonderful, crowning edifice across the waters,
portal to the holiest in gradation of majestic beauty. The Kadu has been
well styled the garden of Java, as Java the pleasance of the East, full
of natural charms which captivate the senses, abounding in amenities
soothing to body and soul; but if it had nothing more to offer than
the Boro Budoor and the Mendoot, it would reward the visitor to those
central shrines of Buddhism far beyond expectation.
