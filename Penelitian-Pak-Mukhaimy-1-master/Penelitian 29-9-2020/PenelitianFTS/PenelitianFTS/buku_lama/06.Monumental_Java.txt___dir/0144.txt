CHAPTER X

THE SOUL OF THE BORO BUDOOR

Ciò ch’io vedeva, mi sembrava un riso
Dell’universo; ...[163]

DANTE ALIGHIERI’S _Commedia_ (_Paradiso_, Canto 27).


It has already been remarked that the natives knew of the existence of
the _chandi_ Boro Budoor long before Cornelius’ discoveries or, rather,
that they never lost sight of it, and the place it occupies in the
Javanese chronicles appears from the _Babad Tanah Jawa_.[164] In the
early years of the eighteenth century Ki Mas Dana, son-in-law of Ki
Gedeh Pasukilan, incited the people of Mataram to a rebellion, which
broke out in the _dessa_ Enta Enta, a centre of sedition it seems, since
only a short time before a certain Raden Suryakusumo, son of Pangeran
Puger, had chosen the same village for his headquarters when rising
against Mangku Rat II., who captured him and put him in an iron cage
without, however, killing him, because the omens were unfavourable.[165]
Ki Mas Dana had many followers and appointed _bupatis_ and _mantris_. Ki
Yagawinata, _bupati_ of Mataram, marched against him but was defeated
and fled to Kartasura, acquainting his Majesty with what had happened.
Thereupon Pangeran Pringgalaya was sent to suppress Ki Mas Dana’s
revolt, with instructions to capture him alive because his Majesty had
made a vow that he would exhibit him publicly as an example to the
inhabitants of Kartasura and let him be _rampokked_[166] with needles.
Pangeran Pringgalaya departed and with him half of the _bupatis_ of
Kartasura. When he arrived at Enta Enta the battle began. Many rebels
were killed. Ki Mas Dana fled to the mountain Boro Budoor. He was
surrounded by the troops of Pangeran Pringgalaya and made a prisoner.
Then they brought him to his Majesty at Kartasura, who ordered all
the inhabitants of the town to assemble in the _aloon aloon_, each of
them with a needle. It lasted three days before all the inhabitants
of Kartasura had had their turn. When he was dead, his head was cut
off and exhibited on a pole. After the execution of Ki Mas Dana, the
news was received that his father-in-law Ki Gedeh Pasukilan had also
revolted. His Majesty ordered the repression of that revolt too. Ki
Gedeh Pasukilan was defeated and killed.
