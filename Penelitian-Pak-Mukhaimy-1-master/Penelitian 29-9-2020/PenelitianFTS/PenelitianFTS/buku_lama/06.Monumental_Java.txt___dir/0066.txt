Selo, Imogiri and Pasar Gedeh: so goes the world indeed, and the
nameless prisoner of war’s motto, preserved near the _pasarahan dalam_,
the imperial garden of rest, would be hardly less appropriate over the
gates leading to the _kratons_, the residences[69] of the Susuhunan of
Surakarta and the Sooltan of Jogjakarta, where they do the grand in
the grand old way, cherishing the memories of a power gone by. A visit
to the Principalities without an invitation to attend some function
at Court cannot be called complete and it is a treat to watch the
ceremonial exercises connected with one of the three _garebegs_[70] or
with the salutations on imperial birthdays and coronation-days in the
roomy _pendopos_, the open halls whose general style betrays its Hindu
origin no less than the aspect, the dresses, the movements of the native
nobility, officials and retainers, an assemblage of a fairy tale, betray
their Hindu parentage. The _bangsal kenchono_, the audience-chamber
of the Sooltan at Jogja, is a masterpiece of construction in wood, the
carved beams and joists, richly gilt and painted in bright colours,
forming a ceiling of wonderful airiness and elegance; in the _bangsal
witono_ the Sooltan shows himself to the people on days of great gala;
in the _bangsal kemandoongan_, a hall in one of the many open squares
of the palace grounds, seated on his _dampar_ or throne, he used to
witness the execution of his subjects sentenced to death, who were
krissed[71] against the opposite wall; another of these open squares
was dedicated to pleasures which remind of the _munera gladiatoria_,
more especially of the _ludi funebres_, and kindred amusements with a
good deal of local colour: we find it chronicled of Sunan Mangku Rat I.,
Java’s Nero, that once he beguiled a tedious afternoon in his _kraton_
at Kartasura by stripping a hundred young women and letting a few tigers
loose among them. The dining-hall (_gedong manis_: room of sweets) in
the _kraton_ at Jogja, to the south of the audience-chamber, can easily
hold three hundred guests with the host of servants they require; at
Solo the imperial stables and coach-houses[72] are scarcely inferior in
interest to the friend of horses, riding, driving and coaching, than the
Kaiserlich-Königliche Marstall at Vienna or the Caballerizas Reales at
Aranjuez. But of all the sights at the Courts of the Principalities of
Central Java it is the human element that fascinates most, a waving mass
of silent figures in the magnificent setting which reflects centuries
of _Sturm und Drang_, the new to the visitor’s eye being nothing but
the very, very old; men taught by fate to treasure their thoughts up in
their hearts, as their mountains do the hidden fire, worshipping _tempu
dahulu_, sustained by _l’amour du bon vieulx tems_, _l’amour antique_,
even the rising generation remaining apparently unaffected by the
example of western fickleness, an inconstancy ever more pronounced since
the illustrious citizen of Florence, of the Porta San Piera, commented
on it:
