[Illustration: XXXI. DETAIL OF THE BORO BUDOOR

(Centrum.)]

The constructive ability of this gifted builder was no less wonderful
than his mastery of detail in aid of his main intent. A clever
system of drainage attests to the foresight of his workmanship; but
the gutters remaining filled up and the gargoyles (open-mouthed
_nagas_) choked after the excavation of the galleries in 1814 and
1834, without any one thinking of clearing them too, the water had to
flow off as best it could in the torrential rains of successive west
monsoons, filtering through the fissures between the stones, passing
down to the foundations and adding, in oozing out, to the causes of
decay by washing the supporting layers of earth and gravel away. The
staircases and passageways to the different terraces and galleries
are constructed with the accurate sense of right proportion which
distinguishes the natives of the island up to this day, and their
_naga_- and _kala-makara_ ornament belongs to the most impressive part
of the graceful decoration. In our ascent from lower to higher planes
of understanding, increasing in perception of the mysteries of life
and death, the Banaspati shows the road, the Hindu-Javanese Gorgon’s
head as Horsfield called it, appropriated by Buddhist architecture,
figurating the terrors of error it faces while budding forth in the
promise of further guidance for whoso shall leave the world’s delusions,
a loved wife, a young-born son, to seek the truth in pursuance of the
Buddha’s ordinance: no intimidation which threatens with the pains of
hell all who dare to disobey the dictates of priestly ambition, but an
assurance of beatitude gained by self-purification. The staircases of
the superstructure correspond with the four approaches leading up the
hillock to the temple-yard; in the course of the excavations, undertaken
to facilitate the work of restoration, one of them, very much out of
repair, has been laid bare. The reconstruction of the lower principal
staircase, whose original position has now been determined, will
result, it is hoped, in the removal of the unsightly flight of uneven
steps masquerading as the main entrance at the corner opposite the
_pasangrahan_; and, perhaps, to provide one worthy of site and building,
the Government will not haggle over the modest sum required for the
re-erection of the monumental gate whose remains were discovered
adjoining the balustrade of the spacious elevated platform.
