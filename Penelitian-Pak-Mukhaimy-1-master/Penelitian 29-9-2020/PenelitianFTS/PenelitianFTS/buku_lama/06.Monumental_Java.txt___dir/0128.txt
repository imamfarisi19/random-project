The wordy war waged around the etymology of the name Boro Budoor, did
not solve the mystery of its origin; all derivations thus far suggested
are mere guess-work and unsatisfactory, whatever reasons be adduced for
Roorda van Eysinga’s explanation that it means an enclosed space, or
Raffles’ surmise that it is a corruption of Bara (the great) Buddha,
or the late King of Siam’s that it refers to the (spiritual) army of
the Buddha, if not to the several Buddhas, as alleged by others. One
of the oldest existing monuments in the island, the foundation of the
_chandi_ Boro Budoor has been attributed by native tradition to Raden
Bandoong, already known from the legends connected with the _chandis_
Prambanan and Sewu, who, as King of Pengging, assumed the name of
Handayaningrat. Professor Kern[145] puts the date of the substructure
at about 850, allowing several years for its completion--if ever it
was fully completed, for this temple, like the _chandi_ Mendoot near
by, the _chandi_ Bimo on the Diëng plateau and so many more, shows
traces of the work having been suspended before the decoration was quite
finished. Sculpture just commenced or little further advanced than the
bare outlining, found on the walls, especially of the covered base;
divers blocks of stone half transformed into ornament and statuary,
Dhyani Buddhas and lions, very illustrative of the methods followed at
different stages of the carving, lying forsaken on the slope and summit
of a neighbouring hillock, disclose an interruption of the labour by
some event of tremendous consequence.[146] Rather than accept the theory
that the ancient temples of Java were left intentionally defective from
religious motives, viz. to emphasise the sense of human imperfection
as an incentive to humility and prostration before the divine, we may
believe in the Merapi, that wicked old giant, having asserted himself in
one of his destructive moods, belching forth flames and ashes, shaking
and burying the handiwork of Hindu and Buddhist pygmies with strictest
impartiality. Standing on the first of the highest terraces on the south
side, says an article[147] in the _Javapost_ of December 5, 1903, one
observes a bulging out of the lower terraces, best accounted for by a
violent earthquake in a southerly direction. When the galleries were
cleared in 1814 and 1834, the volcanic character of the detritus which
filled them (ashes from the Merapi, wrote Roorda van Eysinga in 1850)
and also forms the substratum of the rubbish still unremoved from the
once enclosed grounds of the _chandi_ Mendoot, furnished strong evidence
in support of an eruption of the nearest fire-mountain having been the
cause of the precipitate flight, perhaps the death in harness, of the
builders. Of the preservation of their work too, in so far as finished,
for, to speak again with the writer in the _Javapost_, the very fact
of its having been embedded has saved much of its artistic detail;
and the reason why some of the sculptured parts are damaged to a far
greater extent than others adjoining, is probably that they were exposed
earlier and longer. Deterioration and demolition set in rapidly when
wind and weather began to ravage the wholly unprotected edifice, when
unscrupulous collectors wrought havoc unchecked.
