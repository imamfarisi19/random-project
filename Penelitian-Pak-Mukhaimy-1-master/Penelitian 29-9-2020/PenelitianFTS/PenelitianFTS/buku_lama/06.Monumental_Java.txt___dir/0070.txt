The etiquette at Court is fitly illustrated by the two tea-houses of
Taman Sari, the eastern one for the Grand Pourer-out-of-Tea of the
Right, who presided over the preparation of the delectable beverage
for the Sooltan, and the western ditto for the Grand Pourer-out-of-Tea
of the Left, who provided for the Ratu. A scrupulous punctilio is
ingrained in Javanese habits and customs, from high to low, on great
and small occasions, the native’s mentality always reverting to
things which were, but never more can be. The homage done to sacred
objects, arms, _gamelans_, etc., by giving them a human name and a
title,[80] venerating them as if endowed with supernatural faculties,
recalls Polynesian fetishism, Hinduïsm being blended with it in Siva’s
_trishula_, Vishnu’s _chakra_, etc., which are still carried behind the
native princes among their _ampilan_.[81] The _upacharas_ or imperial
and royal _pusakas_[82] are treated with the utmost reverence when
shown at the appearance in public of Susuhunan or Sooltan, and their
bearers, the _koncho ngampil_, who hold an honoured position at the
Courts of Solo and Jogja, may be considered direct successors of the
envoys of King Dasharatha on the reliefs of the _chandi_ Loro Jonggrang,
who bore his regalia when meeting Rama and Lakshama. The strange
ceremonial, preserved from the time when gods walked amongst men, seems
hardly antiquated, on the contrary very germane to _siti-inggil_[83]
surroundings. One need not visit the _kratons_ though, to notice how
the spirit of the past permeates all things Javanese; any well-dressed
native getting out of his _sado_[84] at the railway station or repairing
thither on foot for a journey with the fire-carriage, will do. Even if
he cannot afford the few _doits_[85] necessary and must impair his
dignity by going afoot, he has his retainers to look after his box
and, stuck behind, he has his magnificent kris in a sheath of gold,
with a beautifully carved ivory handle, in nine cases out of ten a
_pusaka_, cherished like the kris Kolo Munyang of the Prince of Kudoos
or, as others allege, of a Susuhunan of Surakarta, who sent the weapon,
which killed its master’s enemies without human direction, to the
assistance of Pangeran Bintoro, then oppressed by a king of Mojopahit.
The chronology of this legend is evidently a little faulty, but, O! the
wonders of Java’s golden age, and, O! the superstitious honour in which
their memory is held by these lovable people, whose actual existence is
a dream of days gone by. And that happy dream, they ween, is a presage
of the future, prophesying the restoration of their fathers’ heritage.
If, nevertheless, the hour draws near of unconditional surrender, the
Dutch Government steadily and surely arrogating to itself the externals
with the substance of power in the Principalities, they will silently
submit to the _nivarana_ of their ancient faith, the hindrance arising
from torpor of mind appointed to them in the _sansara_, the rotary
sequence of the world, and seek consolation in the promise of their new
faith that the Lord will not deal wrongly with his servants. The life of
nations, like the life of men, starts running as the mountain torrent
and meets many an obstacle before it swells to a broad river in the
plains and flows tranquilly and mightily to the sea; also for Java it is
written:
