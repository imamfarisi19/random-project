The religious principles underlying that empire’s greatness and
providing a basis for a firm sense of duty to guide a temperament of
fire, are nobly embodied in the three gigantic statues placed in the
inner chamber of the Mendoot or, to be quite exact, round which that
_chandi_ was reared, for the entrance is too small to let them through,
especially the largest of them which, miraculously undamaged save one
missing finger-tip, has slid down from its pedestal and consequently
occupies a lower station between the subordinate figures than originally
intended. All three are seated and the first in rank, of one piece
with his unembellished throne, measures fourteen feet; the two to his
right and left, of less grave aspect, wearing richly wrought necklaces,
armlets, wristbands, anklets and tiaras, measure eight feet each. If the
_oorna_[131] more excellent than a crown, identifies the master among
them, the position of whose fingers reminds of Vajrochana, the first
Dhyani Buddha, the others have been taken respectively for a Bodhisatva
and for a devotee who attained by his meritorious life a high degree
of saintliness but whose Brahmanic adornment flatly contradicts the
Buddhist character of such perfection. This explanation is therefore
considered unsatisfactory and unacceptable by many, as, for instance,
his Majesty Somdetch Phra Paramindr Chulalongkorn, the late King of
Siam, who, by the way, when visiting the _chandis_ Mendoot and Boro
Budoor in 1896, claimed those masterpieces of _mahayanistic_ art for
his own, the southern church, to use the incorrect but convenient
distinction. According to this royal interpreter, the idea was to
represent the Buddha in the act of blessing the Buddhist prince who
ordered the Boro Budoor to be built, here placed at his right with an
image of the deliverer in his _makuta_ and carrying no _upawita_ but
a monk’s robe under the insignia of his dignity; the third statue,
directly opposite, at the Buddha’s left, without Buddhist accessories
but with an _upawita_ hanging down from its left shoulder, might
impersonate him again in his state before conversion, or his unconverted
father on whom, after death, he wished to bestow a share in the
deliverer’s benediction. However this may be, there is no doubt of the
Enlightened One’s identity in one of his many personifications and,
leaving the eighty secondary marks unexplored (three for the nails,
three for the fingers, three for the palms of the hands, three for the
forty evenly set teeth, one for the nose, six for the piercing eyes,
five for the eyebrows, three for the cheeks, nine for the hair, ten
for the lower members in general,--without our entering into further
detail!), the thirty-two primary signs are all present: the protuberance
on the top of the skull; the crisped hair (of a glossy black which the
sculptor could not reproduce) curling towards the right;[132] the ample
forehead; the _oorna_, which sheds a white light (also unsculpturable)
as the sheen of polished silver or snow smiled upon by the sun; etc.
Though the colossal statue of the welcome redeemer, like those of the
worshipping kings, does not recommend itself by faultless modelling,
it breathes the spirit which sustains the _arahat_, him who becomes
worthy; it radiates the tranquil felicity of annihilation of existence,
sin, sorrow and pain; it promises the final blowing out of life’s
candle, the Nirvana, when the understanding will be reached of the
Adi-Buddha, the primitive, primordial, immeasurable. And the lowest of
the four degrees of the Nirvana, it seems to say, is already attainable
on earth by emancipation from the bondage of fleshly desire and vice,
by avoidance of that which taints and corrupts.... The noonday glare,
subdued by the heavy shadow of the porch, fills the sanctuary with a
golden haze and upon its dimly gleaming wings a faint music descends,
a song of deliverance. The psalmist’s visions of the covering of
iniquity compass us about and invite to recognition of a common source
of divine inspiration in mankind of whatever creed. The scent of the
_melati_ and _champaka_ flowers, strewn at the feet and in the lap of
the deity--the image of him who taught that there is none such, and
revered by professed believers in the Book which consigns idolaters
to hell-fire!--mingles with the pungent odour of the droppings of the
bats, fluttering and screeching things in the dark recesses of the roof,
disturbed in their sleep. Truly there ought to be a limit to syncretism
and this last mentioned mixture of heterogeneous elements soon affects
the visitor in a manner so offensive that retreat becomes a matter of
necessity.
