FOOTNOTES:

[35] Whence its name, derived from _api_ (fire).

[36] The title Loro designates a lady of very high birth.

[37] _Legèn_ is the liquor prepared by fermentation of the sap drawn
from some trees of the palm family.

[38] From _tangkis_, _tinangkis_, which, derived from _nangkis_, “ward
off”, means “to repel one another.”

[39] _Telaga_ means “lake” and _powiniyan_, derived from _winih_,
“seed”, means a flooded ricefield in which the ears on the stalks, bound
in sheaves, are put to serve for seeding.

[40] Not the last, as this legend has it, for Ratu Boko’s roaring can
yet be heard on still nights, if we may believe the people who dwell on
the banks of the Telaga Powiniyan.

[41] _Padi_ is rice in the hull, shelled by the women and girls, usually
very early in the morning, by stamping it in blocks of wood hollowed out
for the purpose.

[42] Bondowoso’s curse took dire effect and the Javanese lassies of the
neighbourhood, who enter the bonds of matrimony about their fourteenth
year, comment with sarcastic pity on the fact that their sisters of
Prambanan have, as a rule, to wait some ten rainy seasons longer--not
without seeking compensation, it is alleged, after the example set by
their patron saint Loro Jonggrang, whose maidenly life, according to
the _babad chandi Sewu_, of which more later on, was not altogether
blameless.

[43] The very precise ridicule this appellation, which originated in
the childish credulity of the natives, who persist in paying homage to
a statue of Doorga as if it were actually their petrified Mboq Loro
Jonggrang; but the real name of the group being unknown, why should we
reject a distinction not denoted by the less definite term Prambanan?

[44] Major, then still Captain T. VAN ERP in his report to the
_Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences_, January 11, 1909.

[45] The sculptor showed his independence by disregarding the more
canonical number of sixteen or ten.

[46] Stimulated especially by Buddhist and Jaïn influences.
