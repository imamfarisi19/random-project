[165] The insurrection headed by Raden Suryakusumo broke out in 1703
and, according to letters from the Governor-General then in function
at Batavia, to the Honourable Seventeen at home, this Javanese Hotspur
gave a good deal of trouble. Having regained his liberty, he rebelled
again at Tagal, was captured once more and brought to Batavia, whence
the Dutch authorities sent him into banishment at the Cape of Good
Hope, agreeably to the request of Mangku Rat IV. Cf. J. K. J. DE
JONGE, _De Opkomst van het Nederlandsche Gezag over Java_, vol.
viii.

[166] To _rampok_ is to attack one, crowding on him, generally with
lances. The _rampokking_ of tigers after they are caught and again set
free in a square formed by rows of men with pikes, is still a favourite
amusement.

[169] The story points a moral not less relevant to western than to
eastern ethics and runs as follows:

Once upon a time there lived in Mathura a courtesan renowned for
her beauty and her name was Vasavadatta. On a certain day her maid,
having been sent to buy perfume at a merchant’s, who had a son called
Upagoopta, and having stayed out rather long, she said:

--It appears, my dear, that this youth Upagoopta pleases you exceedingly
well, since you never buy in any shop but his father’s.

--Daughter of my master, answered the maid, besides being comely, clever
and polite, Upagoopta, the son of the merchant, passes his life in
observing the law.

These words awakened in Vasavadatta’s heart a desire to meet Upagoopta
and she bade her maid go back and make an appointment with him. But the
youth vouchsafed no other reply than:--My sister, the hour has not yet
arrived.
