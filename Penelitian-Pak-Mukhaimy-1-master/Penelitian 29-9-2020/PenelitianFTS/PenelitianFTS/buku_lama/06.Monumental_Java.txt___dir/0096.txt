CHAPTER VII

BUDDHIST JAVA

Was ist das Heiligste? Das was heut’ und ewig die Geister
Tief und tiefer gefühlt, immer nur einiger macht.[107]

WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, _Vier Jahreszeiten (Herbst)._


Although the theory of Gautama the Sugata’s life-story being only a
repolished solar myth has broken down, its vital element of emancipation
from Brahmanic bonds is certainly much older than Buddhism and the
traditional Buddha but an incarnation of ideas long germinating and
attaining fruition in his teachings, precisely as happened with other
religious reformers who came and went before and after. The thirty-three
gods of the three worlds, “eleven in heaven, eleven on earth and eleven
dwelling in glory in mid-air,” with their three supreme shining ones,
Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, creating, maintaining, destroying and creating
anew, began to pall on the human _trimoorti_ of brain, heart and
bodily wants; the moral dispensation on which the social edifice was
founded, began to need revision. Neither did the orthodox, at first,
refuse admittance to the spirit of emendation. At the _sangharama_[108]
of Nalanda the Vedas were taught together with the Buddhist doctrine
according to the tenets of the Greater and the Lesser Vehicle _à choix_.
The Buddha had to be accepted and was accepted equally by eastern
tolerance and western necessity; while ranking as a divine teacher among
his followers in the legendary development of his precepts, he received
honour as an incarnation of Vishnu among the Hindus, says Sir William
W. Hunter,[109] and as a Saint of the Christian Church, with a day
assigned to him in both the Greek and Roman calendars. Truly, the Hindus
regarded him as the ninth and hitherto last incarnation of Vishnu, the
Lying Spirit let loose to deceive man until the tenth and final descent
of the god, on the white horse, with a flaming sword like a comet in
his hand, for the destruction of the wicked and the renovation of the
world, but he was reckoned with and acknowledged in their mythology,
and the remarkable conformity between Prince Sarvarthasiddha’s lineage,
adventures and achievements, and those of the seventh _avatar_ of the
Hindu deity in the _Ramayana_ are certainly more than accidental. The
law of mercy to all, preached by the blissful Bhagavat, the Buddha, the
Saviour, affected the Brahman creed profoundly; so profoundly in its
deductions, that apprehensive priests resolved to extirpate Buddhist
heresy. But since religious persecution always defeats its purpose,
Buddhism throve with oppression and holds fully its own against the two
other great religions of the present day, al-Islām and Christianity.
