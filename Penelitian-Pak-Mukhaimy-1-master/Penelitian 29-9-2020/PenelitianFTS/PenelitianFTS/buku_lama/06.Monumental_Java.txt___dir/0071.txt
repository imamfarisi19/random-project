FOOTNOTES:

[49] _Batikking_ is the art of dyeing woven goods by immersing them in
successive baths of the required colour, protecting the parts to be left
undyed by applying a mixture of beeswax and resin.

[50] A _stupa_, lit. a mound, a tumulus, is a memorial structure,
sometimes raised over a relic of the Buddha, one of the eight thousand
portions into which his ashes were divided, or a tooth, or any other
fragment of his remains. The combination of such a memento of the Most
Chaste with the emblem of supreme virility is syncretism indeed!

Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indië_, Ser. vii., vol.
vi., nr. 1.

[52] Those not in the Government service: planters, industrials, etc.,
always of lower caste in general, especially official esteem, than
the select who draw their salaries from Batavia. Hence the native
designation of such an inferior individual as a _particulier saja_,
“only” a private person.

[53] _Recho_ or _rejo_ is the name given to any sort of statue.

[54] From _circulus_, circle, something round, which rolls easily away
into oblivion as it is intended to; but, if nothing else, _la folie
circulaire_ keeps the fiction of governmental guidance and control
alive.

Netherlands_, December 27, 1902.

[56] Vishnu’s _vahana_ or bearer, the monster-bird.

[58] The fall of Mojopahit has been put at 1478 (Javanese chronicles),
1488 (VETH’S _Java_, 2nd ed.) and between 1515 and 1521
(ROUFFAER).

[59] Paku Buwono, like Paku Alam, means “nail which fastens the
universe.”

[60] Lit. “the one who has the world in his lap,” _i.e._ the supporter
(ruler) of the world.

[61] Lit. “the one who has the empire in his lap,” _i.e._ the supporter
(ruler) of the empire.
