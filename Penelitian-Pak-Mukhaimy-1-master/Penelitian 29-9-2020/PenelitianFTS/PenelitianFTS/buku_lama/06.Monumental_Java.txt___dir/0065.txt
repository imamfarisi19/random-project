The sacred _waringin_, never wanting in the _aloon aloon_, the open
places before the dwellings of the rulers of the land and their
deputies, what is it but the bo-tree, the tree of enlightenment?
One of venerable age in the imperial burial-ground of Pasar Gedeh,
planted, according to tradition, by Kiahi Ageng Pamanahan or his son
Suta Wijaya, announces without fail the demise of a member of one of
the reigning families either at Solo or at Jogja, by shedding one of
its branches. Pasar Gedeh, Selo and Imogiri are silent spots, peopled
with the dead whose lives’ strength made history and is mourned as the
strength of a glorious past. Selo, an enclave belonging to Surakarta, in
Grobogan, residency Samarang, contains the ancestral tombs of the rulers
of Mataram; Imogiri and Pasar Gedeh in Jogjakarta, which latter marks
the site of the original seat of empire and was comparatively recently
put to its present use, are the cemeteries common to the royalty of both
Principalities, and guarded by officials, _amat dalam_ with the title
of Raden Tumenggoong, appointed by mutual consent. A Polynesian bias
to ancestor-worship, unabated by Hinduïsm, Buddhism and Muhammadanism,
accounts for the almost idolatrous adoration[67] of the graves of the
Susuhunans and Sooltans, their ancestors and also their progeny that
did not attain to thrones, receptacles of once imperial dust, feeding
the four elements from which it proceeded and to which it returns like
meaner human clay. Look, says Kumala in the Buddhist parable, all in the
world must perish! The religious brethren of his faith used to repair at
night to the sepulchres of those taken to bliss and spend the lone hours
in pondering on the instability of conscious existence, desiring to gain
the Nirvana by their undisturbed meditations, but Sivaïte associations
people the old graveyards of Java with _raksasas_, monstrous giants,
eaters of living and dead men and women, and santons, bent on prayer
amid the last abodes of the departed, have been terrified, especially at
Pasar Gedeh, by weird noises and apparitions signalling their approach,
commending hasty retreat to the wise. It is advisable to distrust
darkness there and rather to choose the day for acts of devotion, even
if annoyed by worldlings who come to consult the big white tortoise in
the tank, ancient Kiahi Duda, widower of Mboq Loro Kuning, presaging
the better luck the farther he paddles forth from his subaqueous
habitation. At a little distance is the _sela gilang_, a bluish stone
with a more than half effaced inscription, only the lettering of the
border being legible. Tradition calls it the _dampar_ (throne) of Suta
Wijaya, sitting on which he killed Kiahi Ageng Mangir, his rival and
owner of the miraculous lance Kiahi Baru, who had been lured into his
presence by one of his daughters to do homage by means of the _ujoong_,
the kissing[68] of the knee; near by are a stone mortar and large stone
cannon-balls, the largest possessing the faculty of granting untold
wealth to those strong enough to carry it three times without stopping
round the _sela gilang_, whose legend, carved by a prisoner of war,
either a spirit of the air or a magician, reveals in its marginal
commentary a philosophic mind coupled with linguistic talents: _zoo gaat
de wereld--così va il mondo--ita movet tuus mundus--ainsi va le monde_.
