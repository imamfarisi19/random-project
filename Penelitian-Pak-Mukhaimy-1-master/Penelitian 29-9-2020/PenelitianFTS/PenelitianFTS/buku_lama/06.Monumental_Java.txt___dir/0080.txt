Mojopahit had ceased to exist and the Muhammadans with the Christians in
their wake overran Java, despoiling the land in which toleration and art
could no more flourish, but dissension throve as the tree prophetically
imaged at the Boro Budoor, whose branches bear swords and daggers
instead of wholesome, luscious fruit. The old quarrels over political
supremacy were surpassed in violence by religious strife, and fanaticism
is still held responsible in our day for disturbances conveniently
ascribed to Moslim cussedness when the acknowledgment of the real cause,
discontent born from over-taxation, would be tantamount to a confession
of administrative impotence. It was not Hanoman, the deliverer of
Sita, who troubled the repose of Ravana’s garden, but the _raksasas_
and _raksasis_ who kept her in bonds, and there are two solutions of
the Dutch East Indian problem, independent of the issue celebrated in
the _Ramayana_ and both suggested in the ornament of Java’s temples:
the devourer Time destroying all with his sharp teeth, and the lion,
or tiger, to preserve the local colour, master of the fleeting moment,
with a garland of flowers in his mouth, image of the clouded present
holding out the promise of a brighter future. The two auguries, dark yet
hopeful, belong to one old order of ideas, prefiguring things to come
in dubious language, after the wont of oracles, ancient and modern, and
we can choose the forecast which likes us best. So did the princes of
Daha, Tumapel and Mojopahit, not to mention the lesser fry, creatures of
a breath as we deem them now, doughty warriors and far-seeing statesmen
to their contemporaries, who consulted their soothsayers before treading
the fields of fame and blood whence they were carried to their graves,
admiring nations rearing the mausoleums which now constitute the
greater part of the historic monuments of East Java. The _Pararaton_
mentions no fewer than seventy-three structures of that description.
Such as have been left are, for various reasons, hard to classify,
the greatest difficulty arising from their bad state of preservation,
though deciphered dates furnish important clues, for instance regarding
some _chandis_ in Kediri: Papoh (1301), Tagal Sari (1309), Kali Chilik
(1349), Panataran (1319-1375),[93] the last named being probably
the principal tomb of the dynasty of Mojopahit. Springing from the
soil in amazing dissimilitude, their architects seeking new modes of
expression in new forms and never hesitating at any oddity, at any
audacity to proclaim the message of artistic freedom from convention,
they struggled free from the sober lines and harmonious distribution
of spaces always maintained in Central Java, to run riot in fantastic
innovations. Yet, they held communion with nature and neither shirked
their responsibility nor sinned against the proper relations between
their purpose and the visible consummation of their task as those of
our modern master-builders do who contrive churches like barns or
cattle-sheds, stables like gothic chapels, prisons like halls of fame
and cottages like mediaeval donjons. From such architectural absurdities
it is pleasant to turn, _e.g._, to the _chandi_ Papoh, a temple whose
corner-shrines might pass for daintily wrought golden reliquaries inlaid
with jewels, when the minute detail of their exquisite decoration
is shone upon by the setting sun; or to the _chandi_ Sangrahan,
when warmed to life from death and fearful decay, by the blue of a
measureless sky, again budding from the earth, lovely as the lotus
in the bliss bestowing hand of one of the five finely chiselled but
headless statues near by.
