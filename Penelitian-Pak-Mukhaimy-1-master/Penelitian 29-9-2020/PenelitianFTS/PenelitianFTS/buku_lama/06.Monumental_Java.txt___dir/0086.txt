Several of the bas-reliefs fortunately escaped destruction and found
an interpreter in Dr. Brandes, to whom we also owe explanations of
the stereotyped decorative scrolls and flourishes. Though inferior in
workmanship to the reliefs of Panataran, those of Toompang, “speaking”
reliefs as he called them, are vigorously animated, gaining in interest
to the devotee as he ascends the terraces, their masterly treatment
culminating in what has been preserved on the portion still standing of
the temple-walls. No better illustration of high and low life, of the
nobility and the riff-raff portrayed in classic Javanese literature,
could be imagined; the typical perfect knights and sly buffoons
are there in crowds, princes and courtiers, warriors and peasants,
gallivanting beaux and love-sick maidens, jealous husbands and frisky
wives, worldwise sages and babbling fools, Javanese Don Quijotes riding
out with their trusty squires of the Sancho Panza species, go-betweens
neither better nor worse than Celestina, entangling dusky Melibeas.
Every honourable soul is set off by his or her vulgar counterpart, of
the earth earthy: the _panakawan_ (page) and the _inya_ (nurse) play
most important rôles, almost equally important with those of the hero
and heroine, and their characters are, conformably to the requirements
of Javanese literature, clumsy and coarse but droll; their actions,
whether they accomplish or fail to accomplish their tasks, reflect the
performances of the born ladies and gentlemen whom they accompany, who
lose each other and are reunited, who quarrel and make up, always in a
comely, stately way, proud and sensitive, expressing their feelings in
graceful gestures corresponding with the choicest words. When treating
of Panataran, the ornamentation of the ancient monuments of East Java
in its relation to Javanese literature will be more fully discussed.
Here, however, belongs a reference to Dr. Brandes’ ingenious explanation
of the slanting stripes or bars, left uncarved at irregular intervals
on the narrow tiers of bas-reliefs at the _chandi_ Toompang; comparing
those sculptured bands with the _lontar_[96] leaves on which the tales,
whose illustration they furnish, were originally written, he saw in them
the finishing strokes of the different chapters.
