[72] A story is told of a Susuhunan of Surakarta having ordered a
magnificent landau from one of the first _carrossiers_ in Paris, that
the favoured industrial was advised to send some cooking-pans with it
on delivery. Asking: What for? he got the answer: To poach the eggs his
Highness’ chickens will lay in your carriage. Splendour and squalor live

For usage with mortal man is like the leaf
On the bough, which goes and another comes.

[74] Governor and Director of Java’s northeast coast, afterwards member

[80] Kiahi is a very common one. Dr. J. GRONEMAN, whose
description of the water-castle at Jogjakarta contains a good many
interesting particulars, mentions the name of the barge of state,
presented to Paku Buwono I. by the East India Company, Niahi Kuning, as,
to his knowledge, the only instance of a female appellation being given
to royal paraphernalia--perhaps on the same principle as that which
makes us, too, speak of a ship as of a “she”.

[81] Emblems of royalty; more strictly: objects of virtu belonging to
the reigning family.

[82] A _pusaka_ is an heirloom, generally with luck bringing properties
either to the rightful owner or to any one who secures possession of it.
