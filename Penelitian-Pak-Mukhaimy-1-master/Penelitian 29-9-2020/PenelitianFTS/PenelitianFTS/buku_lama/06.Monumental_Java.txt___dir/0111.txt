FOOTNOTES:

[107]

What is Holiest? That which now and ever the souls of men
Have felt deep and deeper, will always more unite them.

[108] An endowed convent whose inmates spent their lives in studious
seclusion.

[109] _The Indian Empire: its Peoples, History and Products._

[110] After this was written a remarkable article by Dr. L. A.
WADDELL in _The Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review_ (January,
1912), insisting upon the theistic nature of Buddhism and speaking of
the profound theistic development which had taken place--about 100
B.C.--in the direction of the Mahayana form of that faith, pointed
to the fact of Brahmanic gods being also conspicuous in the earliest
Buddhist sculptures of India, adorning, _e.g._, the stupa of Bharhoot.

[111] On rereading this sentence, I see that in writing it I was with
Ruskin at the Shepherd’s Tower. No harm done! His observations bear
repetition, notwithstanding the present fashion of pooh-poohing him, and
setting myself in the pillory as a plagiarist, I improve the opportunity
by making _amende_ (_honorable_, I hope) also for what this book owes to
many other lovers of and thinkers on art, not scrupulously acknowledged
in every instance because I compose without the help of numbered and
dated notes, and memory, though not failing in the essence of what has
been stored from their treasures, disappoints at times in the matter of
chapter and verse.

[112] The _chandi_ Kalasan is the only one in Central Java of which we
possess the exact date.

[113] The _taras_ are the _saktis_ of the five Dhyani Buddhas that
occupy a place in Javanese speculative philosophy, Vajradhatvisvari
pairing with Vajrochana, Lotchana with Akshobhya, Mamaki with
Ratnasambhava, Pandara with Amitabha, and Tara _par excellence_ with
Amoghasiddha, these unions being responsible for the Bodhisatvas
Samantabhadra, Vajrapani, Ratnapani, Padmapani and the coming
Vishvapani.

[114] Here another quotation may be permitted from Dr. L. A.
WADDELL’S article, _Evolution of the Buddhist Cult, its Gods,
Images and Art_ (_The Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review_, January,
1912): And notwithstanding that the Mahayana was primarily a nihilistic
mysticism, with a polytheism only in the background, the latter soon
came to the front and has contributed more than anything else to the
materialising and popularity of Buddhism.
