The skies in the scenery of the bas-reliefs on the lowest terrace of
the _chandi_ Panataran have something very peculiar, termed cloud-faces
by Dr. Brandes, who recognised in the fantastic forms of the floating
vapour as reproduced in the hard stone, demons and animals to which he
drew special attention: a _kala_-head, a furious elephant threatening
to charge, etc. The figures of all bas-reliefs, mostly perhaps those of
the second tier from below, are notable for their departure from the
smooth treatment generally accorded to Javanese sculpture of the period
and best defined perhaps in the phrase of one of Canova’s critics when
he derided that artist’s “peeled-radish” style. Angular and flat, they
remind one of the _wayang_-puppets, and the obvious correspondence
between the manner in which the _chandi_ Panataran illustrates some
of the chief productions of Javanese literature and the performances
of the Javanese national theatre, has been cleverly insisted upon by
Rouffaer. The _wayang_, _i.e._ the dramatic art of the island, sprang
probably from religious observances of pre-Hindu origin. Dr. G. A.
J. Hazeu[100] is of opinion that it formed part of the ritual of the
ancient faith, and even now the _hadat_ requires a sacrifice, the
burning of incense, etc., before the play commences. The Javanese word
_lakon_, a derivation from _laku_, which signifies both “to run” and “to
act”, applied to stage composition, is the exact etymological equivalent
of our “drama”; the _lakon yèyèr_ (_layer_ or _lugu_) confines itself
to tradition, the _lakon karangan_ to subjects taken from tradition but
freely handled, the _lakon sempalan_ to episodes from works otherwise
unsuitable because of their length. The _wayang_ appears, according to
means of interpretation, as _wayang poorwa_ or _kulit_,[101] _gedog_,
_kelitik_ or _karucil_, _golek_, _topeng_, _wong_ and _bèbèr_, of which
the _wayang poorwa_ holds the oldest title to direct descent from the
ancestral habit of invocation of the spirits of the dead. The epithet
_poorwa_ has been derived from the _parwas_ of the _Mahabharata_
which, together with the _Ramayana_ and similar sources, offered an
abundant supply of dramatic material; it is from the _wayang poorwa_
that the Javanese people derive their notions of past events, as the
inhabitants of another island did theirs from their poet and playwright
Shakespeare’s histories before eminent actor-managers set to “improve”
upon his work, mutilating him on his country’s stage in the evolution
of a (fortunately more textual) interpretation, pointedly designated as
Shakespearian post-impressionism.
