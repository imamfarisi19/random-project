The edifice rose from a square base and large statues of Siva as Kala
adorn the feet of the staircases which lead to the first and second
terrace. Of the temple proper not a stone is left; the walls of pit and
terraces are covered with sculpture, a sort of griffins on the highest,
scenes from the _Ramayana_ and illustrations of other popular poems and
fables on the lower ones, beautiful work but irreparably damaged by
official bungling. As if the apathy which suffered this noble monument
to be despoiled and the providentially undemolished parts to crumble
away, had not done enough harm, an amateur invested with local authority
conceived a plan of restoration and preservation on official lines,
that beat even the methods of the art-connoisseurs of the chain-gang
to whom the care for the antiquities at Jogjakarta is entrusted,
which would make reconstruction impossible for all time to come and
deface the ornament in the thoroughest possible way. In obedience to a
Government resolution of June 22, 1900, Nr. 18, the Batavian Society
of Arts and Sciences having been consulted with a view to save the
_chandi_ Panataran from further decay, the Contrôleur in charge of the
administrative division within whose boundaries it is situated, engaged
native masons who, following their instructions, cemented, plastered and
whitewashed to the tune of fl. 989.10 (about £82) with the magnificent
result that the upper terrace has been transformed into a thickly
plastered reception-bower for picnic parties; that everything has
received a neat coat of whitewash to rejoice the hearts of housewives
out for the day with their husbands, little family and friends; that the
architectural detail has been hidden under solid layers of mortar and
cement. Plaster, whitewash and cement everywhere: the noses and other
extremities of the scanty statuary still in place but injured by time
and hand of man, have been touched up with it; from top to bottom it
has been smeared over whatever could be reached, making the venerable
old temple hideously ridiculous--an orgy of “conservation” in the
pernicious official acceptance of the word, hoary age being ravaged by
cheap, destructive “tidying up”. This is how the theory of Government
solicitude for the ancient monuments of Java works out in practice.
