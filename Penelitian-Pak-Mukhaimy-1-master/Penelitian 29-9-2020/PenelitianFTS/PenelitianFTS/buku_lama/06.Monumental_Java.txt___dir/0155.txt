So the son of the merchant comforted the courtesan doing penance for her
transgressions, and she died in a confession of faith to the word of the
Buddha, hopeful of rebirth on a plane of chastened existence.

[170] _Sawahs_ are ricefields, terraced and diked for the purpose of
copious irrigation, in contradistinction to _ladangs_ (Jav. _gagas_,
Soond. _humas_) without artificial water-supply.




BIBLIOGRAPHY


It has been suggested that the practical value of this volume might be
enhanced by the addition of a short bibliography indicating the works
to which students, who wish to go deeper into the subjects touched
upon, could turn for more ample information. _Il y a l’embarras du
choix_ and, always abreast with latest research, particularly the
publications of learned societies as the Royal Institute of the Dutch
East Indies, the Royal Geographical Society of the Netherlands, the
Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, are rich depositories of Dutch
East Indian lore, many of the most important monographs they contain,
being available in book or pamphlet form. Not to speak of the specific
knowledge derivable from such sources as the official Reports of the
Archaeological Commission for Java and Madura, the Bulletins of the
Colonial Museum at Haarlem, etc., from periodicals as _Het Tijdschrift
voor Binnenlandsch Bestuur_ (organ of the Dutch East Indian Civil
Service), _Het Indisch Militair Tijdschrift_, etc., less scientifically
or professionally dressed but just as weighty observations on different
aspects of Dutch rule in the Malay Archipelago can be found in monthlies
like _De Gids_, _De Tijdspiegel_ and, of course, _De Indische Gids_ in
which _Het Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië_, founded by W. R. Baron
van Hoëvell, has been incorporated. The _Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch
Indië_ is a very serviceable storehouse of general intelligence, though
new discoveries made and old theories exploded since its appearance,
emphasise more forcibly with every year, the necessity of its usefulness
being sustained if not by occasional new editions, revised and brought
up to date, then at least by frequent supplements. The _Daghregisters_
of the Castle of Batavia, the _Nederlandsch Indisch Plakaatboek_
(1602-1811), the _Realia_, a register of the General Resolutions from
1632 to 1805, offer almost inexhaustible material for the history of
Java and the other islands in the days of the Dutch East India Company.
J. C. Hooykaas’ _Repertorium_ (1595-1816), continued by A. Hartmann
up to 1893, and by W. J. P. J. Schalker and W. C. Muller up to 1910,
furnishes an excellent index to Dutch colonial literature; C. M. Kan’s
_Proeve eener Geographische Bibliographie van Nederlandsch Oost-Indië_
(1865-1880) and Martinus Nijhoff’s _Bibliotheca Neerlando-Indica_,
1893, should also be mentioned. The following miscellaneous list is an
attempt briefly to enumerate the works, apart from papers accessible
only in serial publications, which seem specially adapted (allowing
a good deal in not a few of them for mutual admiration and all too
courteous, excessive panegyric) to give interested readers further
particulars, according to each one’s individual line of investigation,
with regard to various matters treated of or alluded to in Monumental
Java.
