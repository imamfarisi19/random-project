Fergusson, pointing to the identity of workmen and workmanship in the
sculpture and details of ornamentation at the Boro Budoor and at Ajunta
(cave 26), Nassick (cave 17), the later caves at Salsette, Kondoty,
Montpezir and other places in that neighbourhood, computes that at the
former the decoration extends to nearly 5000 feet, almost an English
mile, and, as there are sculptures on both faces, we have nearly 10,000
lineal feet of reliefs. They numbered 2141 in all, counting what
is damaged and altogether lost, but omitting the decoration of the
ornamental niches: on the lowest wall 408 in the upper and 160 in the
lower tier outside, 568 inside; on the second wall, 240 outside and 192
inside; on the third wall, 108 outside and 165 inside; on the fourth
wall, 88 outside and 140 inside; on the fifth wall, 72 inside. Regarding
their noble qualities of style and decorative value as a component
of the general project, the opinion of a writer in the _Quarterly
Review_[153] may be quoted, who discusses the Boro Budoor’s straight
lines, its untroubled spaces of flat stone, its mouldings of classic
simplicity, its intricate and elaborate bands of ornament, held in place
by the nice choice of relief, being low and unaccented, in opposition
to the deep cutting and full modelling of the panels they surround; and
in these panels, he continues, in spite of the full roundness of the
modelling and the wealth of ornamental detail, the unity is maintained
by a fine sense of rhythm and discreet massing and spacing. The upper
tier of carvings on the inner wall of the first gallery, haut-reliefs
in contradistinction to the rest, represents the life of the Buddha
from his birth until his death and is the best preserved. Many of the
others have suffered so badly that they baffle explanation; taken on
the whole, they treat of traditional occurrences in connection with
the Buddha himself or his predecessors, of gatherings under bo-trees,
pilgrimages to reliquaries, alms-giving, exhortations to observe the
law, admonitions to virtue: abstinence, tolerance and charity. Animal
fables are interwoven with _jataka_-tales, _i.e._ narratives concerning
the Buddha before he appeared as the perfect man, tracing his path to
holiness in his adventures as a hare, a fish, a quail, a swan, a deer,
the king of monkeys, an elephant, a bull, a wood-pecker, a tortoise,
the horse Balaha, every metamorphosis serving to illustrate his zeal
to sacrifice himself for his fellow-creatures and, incidentally,
stimulating the kindness we owe to our poor relations without the
power of speech. Professor Speyer’s translation of legends collected
in the _Jatakamala_ (wreath of _jatakas_) enables us to recognise in a
good many of the reliefs of the Boro Budoor the successive stages of
the Buddha on the road to supreme excellence, the figuration of his
progress being largely influenced by ancient Hindu folk-lore.
