_Che l’uso de’ mortali è come fronda
In ramo, che sen va, ed altra viene._[73]

The country-seats of Susuhunans and Sooltans, where they sought repose
from cares of state, often contained temples erected, if not in the
name then in the spirit of their kind of sacrifice, to Kama, the god
of love, smuggled into the practice of a later creed. They had no
wish to become the victims of their virtue like the excellent King
Suvarnavarna; they did not aspire to the fame accruing to Rama in
his relations to the female demon Shoorpanakha, personification of
sublunar temptations. And the manifold functions assigned to water in
their pleasances, to the limpid, running water of the cool mountain
rills, are characteristic of an island where a bath, at least twice a
day, preferably in the open, is both a necessity and a luxury which the
poorest does not dream of denying himself. Observe the crowds of men,
women and children, always chaste and decent, disporting themselves
in lakes and rivers, every morning and every evening; note the names
of Pikataän, Kali Bening, Banyu Biru, idyllic spots and equal to the
classic _chandi_ Pengilon, Sidamookti and Wanasari to the lover of a
plunge and a swim, screened by flowers and foliage, with the blue heaven
smiling on his joy. Passing by Ambar Winangoon and Ambar Rookma, the
remains of the so-called water-castle at Jogjakarta convey some notion
of the manner in which royal personages sought recreation, amusing
themselves in their parks of delight, fragrant and tranquil like the
restful Loombini, where Maya gave birth to the Buddha; toying with their
women in and round the crystalline fluid. An abundant spring within the
boundaries of the palace grounds led to the conception of this retreat
or, rather, these retreats, for there were two, connected by a system of
canals which speaks highly for native hydraulics, though the buildings
erected to obey a capricious will, show in their present ruinous state
how architecture had degraded since the Hindu period, its flimsy
productions being unable to withstand the first serious earthquake. Of
Pulu Gedong, to the northeast of the _aloon aloon kidool_, nothing
is left but crumbling portions of the walls which jealously guarded the
privacy of the Sooltan’s watersports. Of Taman Sari and Taman Ledok,
situated in the western part of the _kraton_, a good deal is still
recognisable, especially the structures on Pulu Kenanga in the largest
of the artificial lakes which are now dry ground, the one here meant
being incorporated into a _kampong_, one of the several groups of native
dwellings inhabited by the Sooltan’s numerous retainers. The whilom
islands convey in quite a picturesque way the lesson that human works
must die like the hands that fashioned them.
