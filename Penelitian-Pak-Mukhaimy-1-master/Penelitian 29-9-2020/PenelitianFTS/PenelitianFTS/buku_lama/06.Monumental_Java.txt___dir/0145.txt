Dr. Brandes, observing that the _chandi_ Boro Budoor must have been
meant because there is no other place known of the same name and its
strategical value, given ancient modes of warfare, is obvious, puts
the date of its investment by Pangeran Pringgalaya to seize Ki Mas
Dana, at 1709 or 1710. A native reference to the Boro Budoor of half a
century later, is found in a Javanese manuscript, used by Professor C.
Poensen for a paper on Mangku Bumi, first Sooltan of Jogjakarta.[167]
The conduct of the Pangeran Adipati, son of that Sooltan, grieved his
father very much. Besides his ignorance in literary matters, he was
proud and arrogant; he disdained his father’s advice and associated with
the women of the toll-gate, which caused all sorts of annoyance. He went
also to the Boro Budoor to see the thousand statues, notwithstanding
an old prediction that misfortune would befall the prince who beheld
those images, for one of them represented a _satrya_ (a noble knight)
imprisoned in a cage; but it was the Prince’s fate that he wished to see
the statue of the _satrya_. Having gratified his desire, he remained in
the Kadu, where he led a most dissolute life. This gave great sorrow
to his father, the Sooltan, because the scandal reached such dimensions
that the (Dutch) Governor at Samarang heard of it and reprimanded him.
Ashamed and angry, he sent a few _bupatis_ with armed men to order the
Pangeran Adipati to return to Ngajogja (Jogjakarta); if he refused, they
had to use violence and were even authorised to kill him. The Pangeran
Adipati obeyed and was kindly received by his father, but soon after
he fell ill, spat blood and died. A letter of the Governor-General
J. Mossel, dated December 30, 1758,[168] contains the passage: “His
Highness’ eldest son, the pangerang Adipatty Hamancoenagara, having
departed this life, ...” and the profligate Crown Prince’s visit to the
Boro Budoor may therefore be put at a few years less than fifty after Ki
Mas Dana’s rebellion.
