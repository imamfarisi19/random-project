[Illustration: XXXIV. A DHYANI BUDDHA OF THE BORO BUDOOR

(Cephas Sr.)]

Winding our way upward, passing through the galleries whose profound
silence, imbued with the intensely religious spirit radiating from their
sculptured walls, becomes more and more eloquent; circling the terraces
where the attitude of ecstatic elation of the world’s pre-eminently
venerable ones in their _chaityas_ exalts the mind in tremulous
expectation, we arrive at the dagob, the shrine of shrines, the temple’s
coronet, glittering in the bright glow of day. This is the reliquary
proper, the centre into which the holiness of the hallowed building
converges. It rises, similar to the smaller cupolas, but perpendicular
to a height of several feet, from a substructure in the guise of a
lotus cushion; it was also closed round about, without any aperture
so far as can be concluded from its present state, for a portion of
it has tumbled down and the base of the crowning pinnacle, reached by
ill-matched, rickety steps, a recent, outrageously discordant addition,
serves for a bench, the whole, about 25 feet above the topmost terrace,
having been transformed into a crude belvedere, enabling visitors to
enjoy the magnificent view. The interior space seems originally to
have been divided into an upper and a lower chamber; there is nothing
deserving mention in the matter of decoration save an inscription to
remind posterity of the late King of Siam’s visit in the disastrous year
1896--a delicious memorial, at the same time, of official vandalism and
servility. The golden letters affect one unpleasantly in the spoliated
sanctum, whose ruinous condition dates from a previous call, some
sixty or seventy years ago, permitted if not encouraged by previous
authorities, when looting pseudo-archaeologists broke into it and
carried off the relic, which consisted, assuming the credibility of
local reports regarding their disappointment, in a small quantity of
ashy substance, enclosed in a metal urn with lid; furthermore in a
small image of metal and a few coins. The large statue they unearthed
too, would have impeded the movements of the marauders on their return
voyage and so it remained in place, half hidden in the hole they had
dug, undisturbed, for the same reason, by subsequent collectors. Left
unfinished by its sculptor, designedly or not,[156] resembling in the
position of its hands the Dhyani Buddhas which face the East, does it
personify the Adi-Buddha, a purely abstract entity, a metaphysical
conception hitherto defying even symbolic utterance? The learned and
especially the quasi-learned never lacked weighty arguments pro or
contra, and, without prejudice to all they proved and disproved,[157] it
does not appear improbable that the lively imagination of the Javanese
artist aimed at a tangible expression of him who ran his course as the
spirit and source of the Buddhist conception of happiness, resuscitated
from his ashes, dominating East and West, North and South, the blissful
abode of those progressing in self-negation and the infernal regions
of prolonged earthly existence, by the strength of the divine rays
proceeding from the _oorna_, illumining the path trodden by the virtuous
toward annihilation, terrifying the children of darkness, dwellers in
passion and sin, pervading all creation with his saintliness, the one of
the Paranirvana whose essence flowers in the beauty of the Boro Budoor.
And the Moslim native worships him as the god of his ancestors, caught
in stone; smears him with _boreh_ and performs acts of sacrifice before
him in spite of the Book fulminating against idolaters and of the almost
contemptuous familiarity intimated by the otherwise very appropriate
nickname bestowed on this heterodox deity, namely _recho belèq_, which
means “statue in the mud”.
