The short distance between the _chandi_ Kalasan or Kali Bening and the
_chandi_ Sari must have been often traversed by the seekers of the
noble eight-fold path, inquirers into the four truths and examiners
of the three signs, mortifiers of their flesh in the practice of the
ten repugnances. _Bikshus_, living on the alms they collected without
asking by word or gesture, without unduly attracting attention, passing
in silence those inclined and those not inclined to charity, avoiding
the houses and people dangerous to virtue, never tarrying anywhere and
never presenting themselves more than three times at the doors of the
uncharitable, eating the food received in solitude before noon, the only
meal allowed to them, they must have awakened a good deal of pity in
their tattered robes, but one suspects that the mendicant brethren of
Java, notwithstanding their individual vows of poverty, were exceedingly
wealthy as a community after the wont of their kind everywhere and of
whatever religious denomination. Their _viharas_ or monasteries, to
judge from the ruins, were well appointed and the inmates apparently
well provided for by princes who took a pride or found their interest
in befriending religion and the religious. If strictly adhering to
their monastic rules, the Buddhist monks had to live in the open,
but the wet monsoon is not a pleasant season in the woods without
adequate protection against storm and rain, and _avec le ciel il y a
des accommodements_, a motto acted upon long before le Sieur Poquelin
formulated it. The _chandi_ Sari is supposed to have been the main
structure of the residential quarter destined for the accommodation
of the clergy connected with the _chandi_ Kalasan, the abode of the
monks who knew the greater vehicle of discipline as the inscription has
it, the monastery built by command of the Shailendra king for their
venerable congregation and recommended to his successors in order
that all who followed their teachings might understand the cause and
effect of the positive condition of things and attain prosperity. The
rectangular building had a lower and an upper storey, both divided
into three rooms, lighted by windows; the absent roof had niches for
statuary, capped with diminutive domes in the manner of dagobs. In the
decoration extensive use has been made of the elephant and the _makara_,
the fabulous fish with an elephant’s head; images of saints with and
without aureoles, of celestial beings more suggestive of the Hindu
pantheon than of Buddhist atheism,[114] of the bird-people and divers
animals, enliven the rich, flowery ornament of the well proportioned
facings, cornices and window-frames. Rising gracefully from its solid
yet elegant base, the edifice creates an impression of airiness and
stability cleverly combined, the dark gray colour of the weatherbeaten
andesite blending harmoniously with the tender green of the bambu-stools
which transport our thoughts to the garden of Kalandra where the Buddha,
preaching the lotus of the good law, made converts foreordained to rank
among his most famous disciples: Sariputra, Maudgalyayana, Katyayana....
And the officially licensed sinners against the ancient monuments of
Java, hardened, habitual criminals in that respect, expressly appointed
to do their worst at the Paris Exhibition of 1900, pretended their
horrid botch in the Park of the Trocadéro to be a reproduction _d’une
pureté irréprochable_ of this rare gem of architectural workmanship, the
_chandi_ Sari!
