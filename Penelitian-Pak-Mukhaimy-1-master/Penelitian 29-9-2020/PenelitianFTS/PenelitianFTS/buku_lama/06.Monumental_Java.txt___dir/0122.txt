Reviewing the history of the ancient monuments of the island, not one
can pass without a repetition of the sad tale of spoliation. However
unpleasant it be to record in every single instance the culpable
negligence of a Government stiffening general indifference and almost
encouraging downright robbery, the rapid deterioration of those
splendid edifices allows no alternative in the matter of explanation.
When officials and private individuals of the ruling race set the
example, the natives saw no harm in quarrying building material on
their own account for their own houses, and they had no time to lose in
the rapid process of the razing of their _chandis_ for the adornment
of residency and assistant-residency gardens, the construction of
dams, sugar-mills and indigo factories. Temple stones have been found
in many villages round the Mendoot and particularly in Ngrajeg, about
two miles distant on the main road, there is no native dwelling in the
substructure of which they have not been used.[135] Though the wealth of
the _dessa_ Ngrajeg in this respect may be explained by its once having
boasted its own _chandi_, of which nothing remains but the foundations,
there is abundant proof that the chief quarry of the neighbourhood on
this side of the river was the Mendoot as the Boro Budoor on the other.
From a juridical standpoint, the natives in possession of such spoil,
acquired by their fathers or grandfathers, have a prescriptive right on
it not disputable in law, averred the administration at Batavia, and
so whatever the architects in charge of the restoration needed, had
to be bought back and diminished still further the disposable funds.
Leaving the doubtful points of this legal question and the enforcement
in practice of the theoretical decision for what they are worth to
Kromo or Wongso, ordered to part with his doorstep or coinings, there is
_no_ doubt that it is illegal and highly censurable to demolish temples,
and temples like the Mendoot at that, to secure building material for
Government dams and bridges. What happened in Mojokerto with the bricks
of Mojopahit and has been complained of elsewhere, I saw happen in
1885 with Mendoot stones, freely used for abutments, piers, spandrel
fillings, etc., when near by the spanning of the Progo was in progress.
That bridge has since succumbed like the railway bridge then in course
of construction farther down the Progo, a warning which, if heeded,
might have prevented, for instance, the chronic misfortunes of the
railway bridge in the Anei gorge, West Coast of Sumatra.
