Of the delicately carved woodwork hardly a trace remains, but some
foliage and birds among flowers, executed in stucco, give evidence
of a good taste which knew how to make old motives subservient to new
requirements. Though a Muhammadan pleasance, designed by a Muhammadan
architect for a Muhammadan prince, the _garuda_ over one of the
entrances, the Banaspatis on gables and fronts in Taman Sari and Taman
Ledok, the _nagas_ coping the balustrades of the staircases, show that
Hindu conceptions continued to leaven Javanese art. The relations with
China and the consequent influx of Chinamen have also borne their fruit
in Central Java as in Cheribon and the eastern kingdoms: Reimer informs
us that the galleries and tops (now gone) of the several buildings
were constructed like pointed vaults, and were wrought “in the manner
of Chinese roofs”; Pulu Gedong was famous for the lofty Chinese tower
erected near the spring which furnished the water for the “castle”,
its lakes, ponds, tanks and canals, and for the irrigation of its
grounds. The orchards, renowned for their mangoes and pine-apples, the
vegetable-, sirih- and flower-gardens had a great reputation in the
land; assiduous attention was paid to horticulture on the principle,
well understood by oriental gardeners, that flower-beds, ornamental
groves and bowers are like women; that however much art and pains
are bestowed on their make-up, the art of arts is the concealment
thereof.... Writing this it occurs to me how properly a western version
of that universally approved maxim has been put in the mouth of
_Gärtnerinnen_, _niedlich_ and _galant_:

(Centrum.)]

_Denn das Naturell der Frauen
Ist so nah mit Kunst verwandt._[79]

Though Mangku Buwono I. was a contemporary of Goethe, his knowledge of
_Faust_ is extremely doubtful, but being an artist in his own way, he
took care that the natural scenery, assisted by art, should contribute
to a pleasant general impression in the distribution of the dwellings
for his retinue: native princes (and of his rank too!) do not move an
inch inside or outside their _kratons_ without numberless attendants at
their heels. In the “water-castle” were apartments, not only for the
Sooltan, for the Ratu, his first legitimate spouse, for his other wives
and concubines, for the little family they had presented him with, but
for the dignitaries of his Court, officials of all degrees, secretaries,
servants of every description, various artificers from the armourers
down to the _kebon kumukoos_, the makers of _tali api_ (fire-rope),
necessary for lighting his Highness’ cigars. There were reception-,
dining-, living- and sleeping-rooms for the Sooltan, his Ratu and
female relatives, each apart; common rooms for the _selir_ (wives of
lower degree); rooms for the instruction of their children; rooms where
his Highness’ daughters spent a few hours every day in _batikking_;
guard-rooms for the _prajurits_, the male guards; guard-rooms for
the female guards under command of the Niahi Tumanggoong, a lady of
consequence, who kept and keeps the _dalam_, the interior of the
_kraton_, under constant observation so that no illicit _amourettes_
shall occur in the women’s quarters, and yet--! There were store-rooms,
kitchens, workshops, prisons, halls set apart for the dancers, male
and female; the cream of the female dancers, the _srimpis_ and girl
_bedoyos_, were probably housed in or near the principal pavilion on
Pulu Kananga, of which the Sooltan occupied the eastern and the Ratu the
western portion. Above all there were the bath-rooms, dedicated to Kama
and his wife Rati of Hindu memory; and since the parrot is the _vahana_
of that frivolous god, many are the unspeakable tales of revived rites
of his luxurious worship.
