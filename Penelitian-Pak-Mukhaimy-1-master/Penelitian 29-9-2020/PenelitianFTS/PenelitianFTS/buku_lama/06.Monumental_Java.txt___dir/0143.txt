[151] The form of the characters, etc., according to Professor
KERN, points to about the year 800 Saka (A.D. 878).

[154] In the position called _silo_ by the natives, but with the body
straight, not bent forward.

[155] The lowest circular terrace has or ought to have 32, the second or
middle one 24, the highest and last 16 of them.

[156] M. A. FOUCHER points out in the _Bulletin de l’Ecole
Française d’Extrême Orient_, iii., that the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen
Tsiang found another unfinished statue in the Mahabodhi temple near the
Bo-tree of Enlightenment, a statue which, according to the description,
represented the Buddha in the same position, his left hand resting in
his lap, his right hand hanging down, etc.

[157] The literature concerning this statue, says GOENA DARMA
in the _Javapost_ of December 5, 1903, is extensive and rich in curious
conjectures but poor as to scientific value.

[160] Since this was written, the information reached me that the _recho
belèq_ has been taken out of its hole to give it a place somewhere
in the temple grounds where it will be open to inspection, which the
reconstruction of the dagob would have made impossible if left in its
original station. The sacrilege may be condoned to a certain extent if
it implies the disappearance of the tablet intended to keep alive the
memory of the disastrous royal visit.

The illustration opposite page 280 shows the upper terraces and the
dagob after their restoration: the pinnacle of the dagob having been
reconstructed with its crowning ornament, this was afterwards taken away
because of some uncertainty as to its original arrangement.

[161] _Gardus_ are guard-houses erected for the accommodation of the men
who take their turn in watching the roads at night; near the entrance of
each hangs the _beloq_ (block), a piece of wood which, being hollow, is
beaten with a stick to proclaim the hour or to signal fire, amok, the
appearance of _kechus_ (armed thieves), etc.
