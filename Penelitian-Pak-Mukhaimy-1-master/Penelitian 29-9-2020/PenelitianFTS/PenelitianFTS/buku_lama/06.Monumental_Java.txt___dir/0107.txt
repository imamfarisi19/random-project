The decorators in charge of the finishing touches, embellished this
city of temples with a wealth of ornament which in the quivering glare
of day, despite ravage of time and pillage, clothes sanctity in robes
of encrusted winsomeness. The sculpture of the _chandi_ Sewu, says a
visitor of a century ago, is tasteful, delicate and chaste. Much of what
he based his judgment on, has since been carried off or demolished,
but what remains fully bears him out: foliage and festoons, garlands
and clustered flowers, distributed over facings divided into lozenges
and circles by pilasters and fantastically curved lines, with lions,
tigers, cattle and deer in ever varying abundance, awaken reminiscences
of the carvings which excited our admiration at Prambanan and lead
to the question: Did the richly framed panellings of the twenty-four
external wall-spaces of the central temple exhibit scenes from the
epics and fable-books, besides this sumptuous adornment, to match the
almost uniform bas-reliefs of the lesser structures? If so, they must
have rivalled the artistic excellence of the _Ramayana_ reliefs which
beautify the shrines of Siva, Brahma and Vishnu. And a second question
arises: Was the central temple the depository of a relic? In connection
with this query it deserves to be noticed that, generally speaking
and excepting statuary, the internal wall-spaces of the _chandi_
Sewu lack ornament, evince a soberness in marked contrast to the
extravagant representations of the abode of bitterness, as if sign-
or house-painters had been entrusted with the illustration of Dante’s
_Inferno_, repulsive attempts à la Wiertz minus the talent to be admired
in the Rue Vautier at Brussels, nightmares of crude drawing and cruder
colouring to depict perverse torture, I found in eastern edifices raised
to satisfy priestly conventions, even in Ceylon, the island of the
doctrine that the Buddha next to dwell on earth is the Metteya Buddha,
the Buddha of Kindness. More in harmony with the soul’s yearning for his
kingdom to come, is the lotus motive happily adapted to the decoration
of the _chandi_ Sewu, especially in one of the partially preserved small
temples of the outer file, to the east of the southern entrance: from a
strong stem which separates into three branches, on three of the sides,
the entrance taking up the fourth, three lotus-flowers spring from the
soil to carry, in a finely chiselled niche, the (vanished) image of the
expected one, the gone-before and coming-after. A few of the outlying
buildings have plain facings without any ornament at all, from which it
has been concluded that here too something happened to stop the labour
in progress. Where completed, the plump-bellied flowerpot, a familiar
feature in Javanese ornament, enters largely into the decorative design
and its frequent repetition bestows on the sculpture of the _chandi_
Sewu, otherwise so very similar to that of Prambanan, a character all
its own.
