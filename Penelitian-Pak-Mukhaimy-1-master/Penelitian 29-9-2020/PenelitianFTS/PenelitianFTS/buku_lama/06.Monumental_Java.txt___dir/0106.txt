From legendary lore we return to fact in the matter of the foundation of
the _chandi_ Sewu by taking cognisance of an inscription, _mahaprattaya
sangra granting_ or _sang rangga anting_, unearthed near one of its
246 (not thousand) temples,[120] extolling the munificence of the
magnanimous Granting or Anting. The style of writing justifies the
conjecture that the buildings date from about the year 800 and are
consequently of one age with the Boro Budoor. If not erected by one
architect at the command of one bounteous prince, and the gifts of
several pious souls who possessed the wherewithal for devotional works,
they were at least constructed according to one plan steadily kept in
view, a good deal more than can be said of many religious edifices in
western climes, which owe their existence less to co-operative than to
contentious piety. In respect of area the largest of the temple groups
in Java, the first impression received from it is that of a chaos of
ruins, confusion being worse confounded by the quarries opened here
and there, and partly filled again with earth and rubbish, while a
luxuriant vegetation, regaining on the inroads of mattock and pickaxe,
quickly covers what they disturbed. Looking closer, the separate
shrines with their elaborate tracery appear in the fiery embrace of
the sun like sparkling jewels, trembling with delight in the luminous
atmosphere beneath the immaculate sky; the very marks of decay and
ravaging time are beautiful; the weeds clustering round the broken
ornament, the toppling walls, rouse to fanciful thought. No sound is
heard; nothing stirs while we make our way to the principal structure,
once lording it over the smaller ones which stood squarely in four
lines, 28 for the inner, 44 for the next, 80 for the third, 88 for
the outer circumvallation. Excepting those of the second row, their
entrances faced inward and amidst their scanty remains the foundations
have been uncovered of five somewhat larger ones: two to the east, two
to the west and one to the north; like the outlying buildings, these
are, with regard to their superstructures, as if they never existed. Of
the terraces and staircases no other trace is left than the telltale
unevenness of the ground. The resemblance in constructive methods
between the _chandi_ Sewu and the _chandi_ Prambanan strikes one at the
first glance; the same builders, it is surmised, strove here to do for
the Triratna[121] what there they did for the Trimoorti; and if not the
same, they discerned equally the one truth bound up in the old creed and
the new, and expressed it with equal skill and conviction in these twin
litanies of stone--so the workers wrought and the work was perfected by
them.
