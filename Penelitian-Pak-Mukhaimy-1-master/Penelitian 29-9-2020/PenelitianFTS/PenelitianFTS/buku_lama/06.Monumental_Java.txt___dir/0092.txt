A _wayang poorwa_ performance knows nothing of the showy accessories
devised by and for our histrions to hide poverty of mentality and
poorness of acting, futile attempts to make up in settings, properties,
costumes and trappings, tailoring, millinery and disproportionate
finery what they lack in essentials. The performer sits under his lamp
behind a white, generally red-bordered piece of cloth stretched over a
wooden frame on which he projects the figures. He speaks for them and
intersperses explanations and descriptions, directing the musicians with
his gavel of wood or horn, striking disks of copper or brass to intimate
alarums, excursions, etc. Formerly all the spectators were seated
before the screen, as they still are in West Java, Bali and Lombok, but
gradually the men, separating from the women and children, moved behind,
so that in Central and East Java they see both the puppets and their
shadows. The _wayang gedog_, much less popular than the _wayang poorwa_,
evolved from it in the days of Mojopahit as Dr. L. Serrurier informs us;
while the latter draws its repertory principally from Indian epics, the
former with Raden Panji, Prince of Jenggala, for leading hero, is more
exclusively Javanese and prefers the low metallic music of the _gamelan
pelog_[102] to that of the _gamelan salendro_[102] with its high notes
as of ringing glass. In the _wayang kelitik_ or _karucil_, of later
invention and never of a religious character, the puppets themselves are
shown: since _wayang_ means “shadow”, the use of that word is here, for
that reason, less correct, and the same applies to the _wayang golek_
in which the marionettes lose their spare dimensions and become stout
and podgy; to the _wayang topeng_[103] and _wong_[104] in which living
actors perform, an innovation not countenanced by the orthodox, who
are afraid that such deviations from the _hadat_ may result in dread
calamities; and to the _wayang bèbèr_ which consists in displaying the
scenes otherwise enacted, in the form of pictures. Every one finds
in the _wayang_, of whatever description, an echo of his innermost
self: the high-born, smarting under a foreign yoke, in the _penantang_
(challenge and defiance), the lowly in the _banolan_ (farce), the fair
ones of all classes in the _prenesan_ (sentimental, gushing, spoony
speech). It is a treat to look at the natives, squatted motionless for
hours and hours together, their eyes riveted on the screen, listening
to the voice of the invisible performer, marvelling at the adventures
of the men and women who peopled the _negri jawa_ before them and
faded into nothingness, even the mightiest among them, whose mausolea
at Prambanan, Toompang, Panataran, bear witness to the truth of those
amazing deeds of derring-do, love and hate, which will remain the wonder
of the world. To them the phantom-shadows are reality of happiness in a
dull, vexatious life which is but the veil of death.
