[136] _Dapoor_ means “a producer of heat”, “a place where things are
produced by heat”, hence an oven, a kitchen, the priming-hole of a gun.

[137] Before the road was relocated to correspond with the relocation
of yet another new bridge after the last but one’s tumbling down, the
_chandi_ Dapoor stood almost at the wayside; its having been smuggled
out of sight has not improved its chances of preservation.

CHAPTER IX

THE STONES OF THE BORO BUDOOR

... la vérité rendue expressive et parlante, élevée à la hauteur
d’une idée. ERNEST RENAN, _Vie de Jésus_ (_Introduction_).


The _pasangrahan_, built for the convenience of visitors to the
Boro Budoor, offers fair accommodation to the student of oriental
architecture and lover of art in whatever form. Also to a good many
who feel it incumbent on them to be able to say: “I have taken
everything in,” or who have quite other ends in view than communion
with the thought of distant ages: foreign tourists whose principal
care is to exhibit trunks and travelling-bags covered with labels of
out-of-the-beaten-track hotels while their brains remain hopelessly
empty; junketers of domestic growth, often in couples whose irregular
relations seek shelter behind the excuse of “doing” the island, and
heartily disinclined to practise the virtues preached in the reliefs
of the shrine of shrines, particularly down on continence. So even the
Philistines derive advantage, after the notions of their kind, from the
ramshackle fabric of vile heathenism, as this magnificent temple has
been called by one of their number, and its visitors’ book tells a sorry
tale of irreclaimable vulgarity; the wit, laboriously aimed at in many
entries, but widely missed, partakes altogether too much (minus the
element of _badinage_) of the answer given by a young naval officer to
an old aunt when she asked him where, in his opinion, the most striking
natural scenery of Java was to be found: At Petit Trouville,[143] said
he, on Sunday in the dry season.
