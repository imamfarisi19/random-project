FOOTNOTES:

[125] The very appropriate name bestowed on the Dutch East Indies by
EDUARD DOUWES DEKKER (MULTATULI), Holland’s greatest writer of the
preceding century.

[126] General name given to various plants of the bean family; the
_kackang_ here meant, is the _kackang china_ or _tanah_ (_Arachis
kypogaea_) the oil of which is used as a substitute for olive-oil.

[127] The beans or nuts pressed into cakes and used as manure,
especially in the cultivation of sugar-cane.

[128] According to another explanation they represent King Sudhodana and
Queen Maya with Siddhartha, the future Buddha, as a baby in her arms,
which leaves us in the dark about the other children.

[129] Lacking money and wanting money, always more money: a summary of
Dutch colonial policy as it strikes the native.

[130] The influence of eastern fables on western literature and art in
all its branches cannot be overestimated as exemplified for instance,
with special relevance to the one just referred to, by the late
EMM. POIRÉ (CARAN D’ACHE) when he made our old friend Marius imitate
the snail’s braggadocio in his delightful cartoon _Les Pantoufles en
peau de tigre_ (_Lundis du Figaro_). And the story of the vulture and
the turtles found its way, via American plantation legends, into J. C.
HARRIS’ tales of Uncle Remus. Concerning the manner of the “Migration of
Fables” from East to West, most interesting particulars can be found in
MAX MÜLLER’S _Chips from a German Workshop_, iv., p. 145 ff.

[131] The Buddha’s characteristic tuft or bunch of hairs between the
eyebrows.

[132] In consequence of the young enthusiast Sarvarthasiddha cutting
his long locks with his sword when leaving his father’s palace to adopt
the life of a recluse as Sakyamuni, the solitary one of the Sakyas, and
meditate upon the redemption of the world.

[133] The words _chaitya_ and _dagob_ are often used indiscriminately
and every _dagob_ is, in fact, a _chaitya_, but a _chaitya_ is a _dagob_
only if it contains a relic.
