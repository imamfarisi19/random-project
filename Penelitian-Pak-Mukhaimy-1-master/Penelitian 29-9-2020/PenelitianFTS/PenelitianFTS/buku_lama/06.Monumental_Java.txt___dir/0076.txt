It has been conjectured that the migration of Hinduïsm to East Java was
the effect of Buddhism gaining ground in the central part of the island;
that the pronounced Sivaïte tendencies of Mojopahit were a reaction
against Buddhist innovations. But it remains still to be proved that
Mojopahit, though worshipping Siva as the supreme god of the Trimoorti,
adhered to his overlordship in all its orthodox purity. There are, on
the contrary, indications of Vishnuïte leanings, of Buddhist heresy, of
a syncretism no less pronounced than that of Prambanan and the Mendoot.
In the time of Old Mataram’s hegemony, Buddhism must have ingratiated
itself to some extent with her eastern vassals and, though not one of
the temples in East Java is Buddhist after the fashion of the _chandis_
Boro Budoor, Mendoot and Sewu, vestiges of the Bhagavat’s doctrine
are undeniable in Kediri, Southern Surabaya and Northern Pasuruan.
A fusion of Sivaïsm and Buddhism has continuously controlled the
construction of the larger temples of the later eastern Javanese period,
says Rouffaer. Statues found in many places, _e.g._ in the _chandi_
Toompang, are distinctly Buddhist and, what is most remarkable, though
of later workmanship than those of Central Java and of a different
style, tainted by decadent methods, they possess high merits as works
of art. In their Sivaïtic surroundings they confirm the statements of
the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang who, perambulating India between 629
and 645, before the persecution of the Buddhists commenced, remarked
upon the tolerance of the brahmins and _vice versa_, a virtue the
Hindus carried with them to Java as already observed in the chapter on
Prambanan. The kings of Mojopahit followed the example set in those
regions: they were Saivas, Vaishnavas, Buddhists or followers of no
one creed in particular, ready to protect and prefer each of them
according to circumstances. In codes of law and poetry, Sivaïte priests
and _sugatas_, pious brethren on the Buddhist road to perfection, are
mentioned in one breath as conductors of the religious exercises on
festive occasions, invoking the blessings of heaven on harvests and
enterprises of peace and war; the poet Tantular calls the Buddha one
with the Trimoorti.[89]
