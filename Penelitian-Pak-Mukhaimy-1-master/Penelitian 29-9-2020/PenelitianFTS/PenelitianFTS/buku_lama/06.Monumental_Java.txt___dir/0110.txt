This accounts for the sad desolation, more pitiful since _soi-disant_
archaeologists got their hands in, shone upon at the _chandi_ Sewu as at
the _chandis_ Plahosan, Sari, Kalasan, Panataran, to restrict myself to
one name from East Java,--shone upon by the sun, the egg of the world,
whose yolk holds the germ of creation, Surya, the solar orb personified,
is a companion wonderfully, grandly suggestive among the “thousand
temples” of life accomplished, decaying into new birth, whether he
scorches the earth and withers the drooping flowers, or climbs a dim,
hazy sky to attract the vapours that descend again in precious showers
when the clouds collect and cover the stars, charming from darkness the
lovely dawn and budding day. The meditations he disposes the mind to
are mostly directed to the future, dreams of coming happiness, and even
the contemplative Buddhist images under the Banaspatis seem agitated
by their knowledge of a promise excelling the hope of Nirvana, which
cannot satisfy the aspirations of the children of this island, full of
the joy of existence. What will the future bring to them, the people
cradled in tempest, who were taught forbearance by a creed profoundly
imbued with the inner nature of things, and submission when misery of
war and pestilence came as the harbingers of bondage to an alien race?
Too trustful, they sacrificed their birthright for a mess of pottage
and after the encroachments of the Company, past ages crowding on their
memory, the felicity of the _jaman buda_ assumes to their imagination a
tangible shape in the ancient monuments founded by the rulers of their
own flesh and blood, edifices so widely different from the meretricious
Government opium-dens and Government pawn-shops in which the predatory
instinct of the present masters manifests itself--_layin dahulu, layin
sekarang_.[123] Resigned to fate, which wills the mutability of earthly
relations, the Javanese philosopher--and all Javanese are philosophers
in their way--takes the practical view of the Vedantins, considering
that calamities mean purification to the victor in moral contest, and
looking for a serene morning after a night of distress. He has more
beliefs than one to draw upon when seeking refuge in his cherished
maxim, his phlegmatic _apa boleh buwat_,[124] and doubts not the
possibility of obtaining a Moslim equivalent for the Buddhist _arahat_,
the perfect state, irrespective of outward conditions, by the help of
a Hindu deity, Ganesa, who knows what is to happen and, as Vinayaka,
the guide, conquers obstacles hurtful to his votaries in the course
of events preordained according to their Islāmic doctrine--syncretism
yet more complex than that of their forefathers of Old Mataram!
Watch well the heart, commanded the master. As to the watched heart
dominating the senses, the Javanese, rather a mystic than an ascetic,
and predominantly a child of nature, whence he proceeds and whither he
returns in his search of the divine, prefers enjoyment of the world’s
fullness to mortification of the flesh. He feels much more closely drawn
to Padmapani, the lord of the world that is, than to any other of the
emanations of the essence of the Universe, be it Diansh Pitar or the
One, the Eternal, who sent Muhammad as a mercy to all creatures, or the
Adi-Buddha, the primitive, the primordial, the incarnate denial of god
and soul together. Whatever he prays by, the deity involved is one of
overflowing gladness, who presents a flower with each hand, like Surya
when circling land and sea and air in three steps; and, notwithstanding
his sorrows, he rests content with his portion for, though the light of
day sets, it will rise again in glory.
