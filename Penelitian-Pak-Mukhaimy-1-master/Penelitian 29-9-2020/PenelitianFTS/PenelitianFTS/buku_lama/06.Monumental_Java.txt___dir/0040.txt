FOOTNOTES:

[22] Dr. A. B. COHEN STUART, however, derives Diëng from
_dihyang_, the name found by him in old records.

[23] The remains of both these exquisite little temples suffered
severely from a gale in 1907, which blew some of the surrounding trees
down, their trunks and branches falling heavily and disjoining the
still tolerably erect walls, the _chandi_ Perot, according to latest
intelligence, being wholly destroyed by the toppling of the tamarind it
supported.

[24] The _Brata Yuda Yarwa_ is the Javanese version of the famous Kawi
poem _Bharata Yuddha_ which, in its turn, is founded on the Sanskrit
epos _Mahabharata_. The war for the possession of Hastinapura is
transplanted to Java; the Sanskrit proper names have passed into the
nomenclature of Javanese history and geography; the Indian heroes have
become the founders of Javanese dynasties, the progenitors of Javanese
nobility.

[25] One of those chasms, near the _dessa_ Gaja Moongkoor, swallowed not
merely a dancing-girl, a most common occurrence in Javanese legendary
lore, but a whole village.

[26] A very active mofette which the natives call the Pakaraman, _i.e._
the “selected spot” where King Baladeva had his arms forged in the Brata
Yuda war.

What is the use of living, of kissing lovely flowers,
If, though they are beautiful, they must soon fade into nothing?

[28] The native’s deferential fear for the animal in question, makes
him reluctant to pronounce its name, a liberty likely to give offence;
referring to the lord of the woods, he speaks rather of his respected
uncle (_paman_) or grandfather (_kakeh_), which satisfies, at the same
time, his lingering belief in the transmigration of the soul.

[29] Siva as Kala, the destroyer with the lion’s or tiger’s head,
Banaspati, devouring the sea-monster Makara: time finishing all
things and alleviating all distress, in respect of which notion
VOLTAIRE’S short but pointed story of _Les Deux Consolés_ may
be profitably read.
