FOOTNOTES:

[143] Such is the name given to a stretch of beach, not far from
Tanjoong Priok, the harbour of Batavia, much resorted to, for bathing
and advertisement, by that city’s frail sisterhood, and Batavians will
appreciate the young naval officer’s _bon mot_ better than did his aunt,
a provincial spinster, when at length she fathomed it.

[144] A description, dated October 12, 1858, informs us that the piece
of ivory, supposed to have garnished the jaw of Gautama, is about the
size of the little finger, of a rich yellow colour, slightly curved in
the middle and tapering. The thickest end, taken for the crown, has a
hole into which a pin can be introduced; the thinnest end, taken for the
root, looks as if worn away or tampered with to distribute fragments of
the relic.

[146] According to another explanation these incompleted pieces of
sculpture, found lying about, were rejected in the building because they
did not come up to the architect’s requirements.

It is no indiscretion, I believe, to reveal behind this significant
pseudonym Father P. J. HOEVENAARS, of whose sagacious observations
I shall avail myself repeatedly in the following account of the
temple’s history.

[148] Invention being stimulated by quasi-historical novels like
GRAMBERG’S _Mojopahit_.

continued by Captain E. S. DE KLERCK and published under the auspices
of the _Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences_, vols. i. and ii.

[150] This holds good for western as well as eastern lands and,
whether true or false, the story of Napoleon’s dragoons converting the
refectorium of Santa Maria delle Grazie at Milan into a stable and
adjusting their horses’ mangers against da Vinci’s _Cena_, expresses
very well what cavalry on the warpath are capable of.
