RETURN TO THE COAST.

On the 14th arrived at Moco-moco; on the 22nd proceeded for Bencoolen,
and arrived there on the 30th March 1805, after one of the most fatiguing
and harassing expeditions any detachment of troops ever served upon;
attended with the sickness of the whole of the party, and the death of
many, particularly of Mr. Alexander, the surgeon.

End of Lieutenant Dare's narrative.

It is almost unnecessary to observe that these were the consequences of
the extreme impolicy of sending an expedition up the country in the heart
of the rainy season. The public orders issued on the occasion were highly
creditable to Lieutenant Dare.

MALAYAN STATES.

I shall now take a more particular view of the Malayan states, as
distinguished from those of the people termed orang ulu or countrymen,
and orang dusun or villagers, who, not being generally converted to the
Mahometan religion, have thereby preserved a more original character.

EMPIRE OF MENANGKABAU.

The principal government, and whose jurisdiction in ancient times is
understood to have comprehended the whole of Sumatra, is Menangkabau,*
situated under the equinoctial line, beyond the western range of high
mountains, and nearly in the centre of the island; in which respect it
differs from Malayan establishments in other parts, which are almost
universally near the mouths of large rivers. The appellations however of
orang menangkabau and orang malayo are so much identified that,
previously to entering upon an account of the former, it will be useful
to throw as much light as possible upon the latter, and to ascertain to
what description of people the name of Malays, bestowed by Europeans upon
all who resemble them in features and complexion, properly belongs.
