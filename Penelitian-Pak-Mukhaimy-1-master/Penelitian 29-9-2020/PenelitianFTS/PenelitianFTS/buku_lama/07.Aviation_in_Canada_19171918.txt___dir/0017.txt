The Chief Engineer of this section directed executive work, his
assistant supervised construction. With them were the heads of
the draughting room, the estimating section and the construction
purchasing department, together with the chief electrician,
the plumbing superintendent, the heating superintendent, road
superintendent and the head of the commissary and transport section.
In the section office a staff of fifty was employed, when in the
middle of October, 1918, there were 2,200 men on the payroll. The
following diagram illustrates the organization:--

The Construction Section was, in fact, pivoted so that it might at
any moment turn its attention to new work without departing from its
main and central programme, and to this flexibility is attributable
the unquestionable success it achieved.




CANADIAN AEROPLANES LIMITED.


This organization saw the light officially in December, 1916, and in
twenty-one months had turned out some 2,900 aeroplanes, valued at
nearly fourteen million dollars. Incidentally, the factory covered
about six acres, and employed something over two thousand hands.

It was some time before Canadians realized that the undertaking was
that of the Imperial Government acting through the Imperial Munitions
Board, more familiarly known as the “I.M.B.” The primary purpose was
that of supplying aeroplanes for the Royal Flying Corps, but actually
some four and a half millions’ worth of output went to aid training
in the United States.
