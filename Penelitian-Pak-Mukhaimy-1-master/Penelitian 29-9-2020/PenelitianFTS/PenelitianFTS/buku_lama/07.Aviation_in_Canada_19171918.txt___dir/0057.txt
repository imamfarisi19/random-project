At the time of the signing of the armistice, over 7,000 men had been
recruited for the mechanical section of the Royal Air Force, Canada.
Nearly fifty per cent. of these were recruited by correspondence,
and as many as 15,000 applications were handled through recruiting
headquarters and the various out-stations.

CADETS.

When on May 1st, 1917, the campaign was commenced, the assistance
of the Aero Club of Canada was enlisted, and this society used its
organization as a recruiting agency.

At the same time, endeavours were made to approach the students of
public schools and universities by extensive circularization. It was
estimated that about 600 cadet recruits could be handled for training
for the balance of 1917, and about 1,500 in 1918, but although
thirty-odd schools and colleges were thus approached, the scheme was
unproductive of results. It was decided, therefore, to try out more
thoroughly the idea of civilian recruiting committees, and bodies
composed of about three influential, public men were organized in the
following cities:--

Toronto, Ontario.
Montreal, Quebec.
Charlottetown, P. E. I.
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Regina, Saskatchewan.
Calgary, Alberta.
Vancouver, British Columbia.
