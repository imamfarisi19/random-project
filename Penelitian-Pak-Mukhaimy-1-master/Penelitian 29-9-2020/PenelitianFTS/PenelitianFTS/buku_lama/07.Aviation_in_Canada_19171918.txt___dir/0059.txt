About this time the Military Service Act commenced to operate and
there seemed a danger of all the available material being absorbed
into C.E.F. units. A reserve class “B” was therefore started, and the
surplus cadets were placed on this reserve.

From this time on, committees coöperating more fully, the number of
applicants steadily increased and there has been no difficulty since
then in supplying the demand for cadets.

The difficulties encountered in cadet recruiting were:--

(1) The task of informing the public that cadets would be taken
for training as pilots. Not only had the fact to be known that
men were wanted, but it was also necessary to say exactly what a
pilot had to do. There still seems to be an impression that it is
very difficult to gain admittance as a pilot.

(2) Before the Royal Flying Corps, Canada, was formed, pilots
were trained at a civilian school. They paid about $400 for
the course, and then had to take a chance of being accepted in
England. The general public required to be acquainted with the
fact that training was _free_ at an Army School.

(3) It was absolutely impossible to interview all the applicants
at headquarters or at brigade centres, or to deal with them by
correspondence. The committees formed were, therefore, given this
work, and as soon as they thoroughly realized the requirements,
they rendered the very greatest service, and have been, as
pointed out, the backbone of cadet recruiting.

(4) The medical examination of cadets presented almost similar
difficulties to that of mechanics. Brigade standards were
entirely different from those usually adopted by the local
boards. It was very difficult to secure an examination which was
anything more than superficial.

The Barany revolving chair is now employed, and in doubtful cases
trial flights involving specified tests are given. In this way
it has been possible to accept some borderline cases, where under
the old system rejections would have been inevitable.
