The second mail was carried from Toronto to Ottawa. It left Leaside
in C-280, piloted by Lieut. T. Longman on August 15th, returning on
August 17th. The easterly flight took 280 minutes and the return trip
220 minutes.

On August 26th, Lieut. A. Dunstan in machine C-282 again carried the
mail to the Capital, taking 220 minutes in each direction. Lieut. H.
Burton in the same machine repeated this flight in similar time on
September 4th, the latter officer making the round trip in a single
day.

The Aero Club, for the purpose, arranged with the Dominion Government
for the use of a special stamp, of the design illustrated. Thus
was inaugurated a service which should in the near future develop
enormously in this country of great distances.

The above acknowledgments are perforce fragmentary, as it is
impossible to extend to each and all in any other form the thanks
which the brigade desires to offer. It is hoped, therefore, that
those to whom individual reference is not here made will accept this
assurance of the great value the unit has placed upon services so
generously offered and so gratefully received.
