NORTH TORONTO.


The North Toronto wing was the third flying station of the brigade to
go into action. It was subdivided into two units, Leaside and Armour
Heights, the ground for the former being most generously offered free
of charge by the York Land Company and the town of Leaside; while for
the use of the latter area the Corps is indebted to F. B. Robins, Esq.

Actual construction commenced on May 21st. Leaside, comprising 222
acres, presented an admirable surface which was carefully drained.
The structural programme called for nine flight sheds, together with
instructional and repair buildings, etc. At the close of hostilities
there was accommodation for 89 officers, 230 cadets, 83 warrant
officers and sergeants, and about 600 rank and file, the latter being
housed in a large factory building, the use of which was secured
from the Leaside Munitions Company. In the autumn of 1918, work
was commenced on a central heating plant serving the officers’ and
cadets’ quarters.

The territory north, east and west of Leaside presented a country
with fairly large fields and but little wooded land, and there
was in consequence every opportunity for forced landings. As this
station was the main point at which training was given in artillery
coöperation, a most complete system of observation huts connected
by telephones, was constructed and dotted the countryside for miles
around.

Leaside has always been a point of interest to visitors on account
of its proximity to Toronto, and has had the honor of inspection by
H.R.H. Prince Arthur of Connaught and the Duke of Devonshire, at
that time Governor-General of Canada. From Leaside also started the
aerial mail which, under the auspices of the Aero Club of Canada,
made several trips to Montreal and Ottawa, and demonstrated the great
advantage that will no doubt accrue from the use of aerial transport
for this purpose.
