TRAINING IN GENERAL.


To achieve a brief review of the progressive instruction received
by pilots and observers, it is unfortunately necessary to omit
reference to many developments which from time to time built up the
system finally secured. This is the more regrettable, since the
foundations were laid under strenuous circumstances. Insufficient
staffs provided with meagre equipment, much of which they themselves
had to evolve, did notable service at a time when the demands upon
them were constantly increasing. It is hoped, therefore, that those
to whom the brigade is indebted for a vast amount of admirable and
constructive effort will realize the impossibility of any descriptive
detail concerning it, and will find in the ultimate methods adopted
the essential fruit of their early labours.

To the photographic record of training on these pages it is now
desired to add certain data concerning the routine of instruction.

The cadet enlisting in the Spring of 1918 proceeded to the Cadet
Wing at Long Branch after passing through the Recruits Depot,
where he received an initiation into infantry training and buzzing
(telegraphic receiving and sending) up to his ability in the period.
Here he was clothed, equipped and given lectures on personal hygiene,
discipline, and the primary features of the R.A.F. This course did
not exceed two weeks.

During the eight weeks at the Cadet Wing the pupilâ€™s horizon
broadened. He found also that every inducement was offered to
proficiency and hard work, for instruction continued even in
hospital, provided he was fit to receive it. Sports and physical
exercise kept him in condition, and leave was frequent.
