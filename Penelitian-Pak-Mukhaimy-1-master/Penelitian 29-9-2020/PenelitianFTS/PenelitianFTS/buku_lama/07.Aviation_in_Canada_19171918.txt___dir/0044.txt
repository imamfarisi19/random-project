“In order to stimulate those canals lying in the vertical plane,
‘falling tests’ are employed. The subject is instructed to lean
forward, resting his forehead on his hands which are placed on his
knees, and is then turned alternately to right and left five times in
ten seconds.

“Should he be rotated to the right and be ordered to sit up, he
should immediately fall to the right, which is the normal reaction,
but should he sit directly upright or fall to the opposite direction,
a faulty functioning of these canals or of the pathways in the brain
is thus demonstrated.

“‘Pointing tests’ are applied somewhat similarly. The candidate is
turned ten times in ten seconds alternately to right and left, with
eyes closed. He is then instructed to raise his arm and point to
a fixed object, usually the examiner’s finger, of the position of
which he is already aware. As a result of the dizziness produced,
if he has been turned to the right, he should point to the right
of the object. This ‘past-pointing’ is a normal reaction, and any
considerable deviation will immediately reject the applicant. Even
after the chair has stopped, the man still feels that he is turning
and is endeavouring to locate the fixed point. The ‘past-pointing’
shows that he is attempting to allow or the rotary motion which he is
still experiencing, though actually the chair is stationary.

“Since the more sensitive, theoretically, a man is, as shown by
‘turning tests,’ the more likely he is to be a good pilot, as he
should be able to detect more accurately and early the movements of
his plane without the use of his eyes. This is, however, true only
to a limited degree, for we have found that as a rule the higher the
nystagmus time, the more likely is the man to suffer from vertigo,
nausea or vomiting in the air. On the other hand, theoretically, a
man with a short period of nystagmus should be less sensitive to
unpleasant, subjective sensations, and those with ‘dead labyrinths’
ought to be immune.
