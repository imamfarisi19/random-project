In the Stores Depot, as well as in all other units, excellent service
has been rendered by lady civilian subordinates, and in October no
less than 184 were on the strength of this unit. There was required,
of course, the special training of those hitherto unskilled in these
particular duties, but the result has amply justified the trouble
taken. Over and above the civilian subordinates, there were on the
strength 17 officers and 217 other ranks. All have contributed to
a notable degree to the success of the work of other units, which
without a constant dependable supply of necessary equipment would
have been soon rendered ineffective.




THE PAY OFFICE.


The Pay Officer arrived in Canada on the 11th February, 1917, with
four non-commissioned officers of the Imperial Army Pay Corps and
eight boxes of army books and forms, the latter, however, being
practically useless. Canadian conditions were vastly different from
those in England.

A suitable office was located at 20 Victoria Street. The Pay Officer
then immediately notified the press of his arrival and address, and
work began on February 17th, necessary funds being drawn from the War
Office through the British Remount Commission in Montreal.

Owing to values in Canada varying widely from those prevailing in
England, it was essential to tread very warily regarding the fixing
of rates of pay and allowances and innumerable other points known
only to those who have experience in an Army Pay Office.

Once in the swing, and after numerous conferences and interviews with
Imperial and Canadian authorities, the department became a hive of
industry. Its extraordinary growth may be seen from the following
