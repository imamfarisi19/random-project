DESERONTO.


The Town of Deseronto is on the north shore of Lake Ontario, some 130
miles east of Toronto. Between it and the main body of the lake, lies
the island county of Prince Edward. Here, at points three miles west
and one and a half miles north, were selected the two aerodromes of
camps Mohawk and Rathbun, the former being part of an Indian reserve,
the use of which was secured through the agency of the Department
of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, the latter being a level farm owned by
a prominent family in the town of Deseronto. Work commenced during
April, 1917, and was sufficiently far advanced to enable machines to
take the air in the following month.

The technical equipment at Mohawk ultimately consisted of twelve
flight sheds (four squadrons), with complete provision for aeroplane
repair and ground instruction, the engine repair work being done
in rented sheds in the town of Deseronto. The aerodrome itself was
unusually level and the surrounding country fairly open. A large
amount of flying took place, of course, over water. Within easy reach
to the eastward lies that exquisite expanse of the St. Lawrence River
which encircles the Thousand Islands.

The camp buildings, centrally heated, crowned an eminence lying
between the aerodrome and the waterâ€™s edge, a beautiful site which
commanded an excellent view of the adjacent country. Mohawk, with the
neighboring camp of Rathbun, was occupied during the early summer of
1917 by the 43rd Wing, headquarters administration being housed in
the Town of Deseronto, from which both camps could easily be reached.

The development of training, confined at first to aerial work, was
carried to the point of giving ground and gunnery instruction, and an
excellent range was constructed near the barrack buildings. Water
was drawn from the lake nearby and chlorinated for use, while ample
electrical facilities were secured from the transmission circuits of
the Provincial Hydro-Electric system.
