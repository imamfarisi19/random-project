The officials of the Company were:--

President          SIR FRANK BAILLIE, K.B.E.
Vice-president     MR. FRANK P. WOOD.
Director           MR. W. PARKYN MURRAY.
Manager            MR. E. T. MUSSON.

Chief Engineer     MR. M. R. RIDDELL.

Work commenced in leased premises, where the plant of a small factory
which had a year or so before turned out a few experimental machines
was for three months utilized. This, admittedly a makeshift, expanded
in April into permanent premises on Dufferin Street, covering
ultimately some six acres of floor space, with innumerable mechanical
appliances specially designed for the work. The building of this
factory proved something of an achievement, being completed in about
two and one-half months, a notable record even in a country where
quick construction was the rule of the day. The site, carefully
chosen, lay surrounded by the homes of large numbers of technical
tradesmen, and this helped in no small degree to ensure at all times
a full force of highly skilled employees.
