PAYMENT


Fuel requirements for the current year, for instance, were estimated
at nearly 30,000 tons, and, in spite of certain official privileges
extended to the Department, shipments of this magnitude called for
very special attention, particularly at a time when great public
anxiety was felt in securing fuel supply.

Gasoline requirements comprised about 16,000 gallons per month, and
this, owing to the limited storage capacity at the various wings, was
very carefully watched and traced in transit. It speaks well for the
Department that during a period when the railway system was congested
with freight, flying was not at any time interfered with owing to
shortage of this supply.
