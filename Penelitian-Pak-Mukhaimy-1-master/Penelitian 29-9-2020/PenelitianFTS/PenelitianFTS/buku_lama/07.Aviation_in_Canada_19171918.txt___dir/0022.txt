Boat building was, however, but a side issue of the primary purpose
of the organization. It was formed to supply an Imperial brigade
with ample and satisfactory aeroplanes. That this was done is
unquestionable; but it is questionable whether those responsible
for its organization and those under whose guiding hands it grew so
amazingly foresaw the proportion the business was to assume or the
peculiarly intimate relationship it established with the work of
the brigade. The various reports of the General Officer Commanding on
this subject pay unstinted tribute to the excellence of the service
rendered. More than this, it is due to the qualities of the Canadian
JN4 machine as manufactured in Toronto by the Canadian Aeroplanes
Limited that training in flying by the Royal Air Force was so
advanced that it covered the practice of all aerial manoeuvres and
“stunts” possible on any machine.

In the graphs on pages 54 and 55 will be found certain data of
interest giving the progress of manufacture, etc., but the essential
figures are those not written. They are to be found, if computable,
in the service rendered to the Empire by some three thousand pilots
who first took to the air in machines made by this great national
plant.

THE COST OF TRAINING


Herewith is given a diagram presenting the net cost of the work of
the brigade in Canada. The disbursements indicated include the total
of all sums paid out both by the Corps and the Aviation Department of
the I.M.B.

This cost, being $9,835 per pilot trained, will, it is estimated,
be reduced to $9,660 when the various assets of the brigade have
been liquidated. It will be seen that no amount has been apportioned
against the complete training of 137 observers, and the partial
training of 3,500 cadets who were on the strength and in various
stages of ground tuition in November, 1918.
