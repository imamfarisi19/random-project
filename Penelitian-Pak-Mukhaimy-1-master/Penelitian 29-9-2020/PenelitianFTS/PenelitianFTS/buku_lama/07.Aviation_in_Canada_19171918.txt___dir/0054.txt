The question of publicity presented a problem, to solve which the
following methods were employed:

(1) Display advertisements in newspapers (large dailies).

(2) Written items of news and interesting articles.

(3) Classified advertisements for trades in the various want
advertising columns.

(4) Large posters of striking design used on bill-boards. These
posters were designed by an advertising company.

This work was supplemented by addresses and recruiting meetings.

The cost of (4) was too high to be maintained, and the results of (1)
and (2) were so discouraging in the first month that another scheme
was evolved. As a result of a conference with the National Board,
some 10,000 skilled workers who had volunteered for national service
were circularized with attractive literature. From this form of
publicity only 860 enlistments were obtained, extending over a period
of nearly six months.

On investigation, it was found that the first method of publicity
had been so long used by local Canadian Forces that the effect
lacked novelty, whereas information conveyed in articles dealing
with aviation always brought results. Since display advertisements,
however, were a sure means of reaching the public, they were
continued, inasmuch as they served to stimulate the interest of the
newspaper, and thereby helped in the placing of news items.

The entry of the United States into the war made it possible to
endeavour to recruit British subjects across the line. Quarters were
secured in New York, and officers visited many of the larger towns,
such as Chicago, Boston, Kansas City, St. Louis, Minneapolis, etc.,
where the British Recruiting Mission had offices, and gave every
possible assistance. Occasional visits were paid to these points,
except in the case of New York, where an officer was permanently
stationed, and from New York came the bulk of the men enlisted in
the United States. Altogether about 627 British subjects were thus
enrolled.
