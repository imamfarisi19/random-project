It will be observed that although training was continually being
intensified, fatalities decreased from 1 in 1,760 hours’ flying in
July 1918, to 1 in 5,300 hours’ flying in October, 1918, and this
in spite of the fact that pilots were doing all aerial manoeuvres.
Official data from other training centres, where work was done on
varying types of machines, show 1 fatality for 1,170 hours’ flying.

THE R.F.C. IN TEXAS.


The entry of the United States into the war affected almost
immediately the programme of the R.F.C. in Canada. There was now next
door, instead of a neutral if friendly nation, a vast organization
associated with us in the greatest of all undertakings, and when
in April the O.C. was authorized to visit the War Department in
Washington and discuss a reciprocal scheme for training pilots, he
found the U.S. authorities animated by the keenest possible spirit.
The idea of coöperation was attractive to both services. It would
not only stimulate a most desirable comradeship between the two, but
would be of direct assistance to the U.S. Signal Corps in training
their tremendous reserves of admirable recruits, as well as possibly
obviate the necessity of the R.F.C. forming a fourth wing in British
Columbia, where the preparation of aerodromes was already under way.

The move was preceded by formal communications between the two
governments, but the details of organization, equipment and training,
on behalf of the British, rested with the O.C., R.F.C., Canada.
Briefly they were as follows:--

(1) The R.F.C. was to train ten squadrons for the U.S. Signal
Corps, comprising 300 pilots, 144 other flying officers, some 20
administrative and equipment officers and approximately 2,000
mechanics. This training was to be commenced immediately in Canada,
and completed at Fort Worth, Texas. All training equipment,
aerodromes, etc., in Canada to be provided by the R.F.C.
