From December, 1917 to April, 1918, both brigade and Imperial
Munitions Board expenditures show a decrease. This is due to the fact
that for these months the cost of aeroplanes, engines, spares, etc.,
were met by the U.S. Signal. Service, for whom the Corps trained
a large number of pilots. The amount thus saved by the Corps may
be considered as approximately equal to that spent on the partial
training of 3,500 cadets and included in the gross sum mentioned.

The increase in outlay by the Imperial Munitions Board in the autumn
of 1918 was occasioned by a large building programme, designed to
accommodate the entire brigade in winter quarters, no further move to
Texas being contemplated. When hostilities ceased this accommodation
was practically finished.

It will be noted that the winter of 1918 found the brigade with its
capital expenditure complete, and subject only to such maintenance
charges as rations, pay, repairs, etc. Had training, therefore, been
continued, it is without doubt that pilots would have been turned out
at a cost very much less than that above indicated.

HEADQUARTERS STAFF.


The duties undertaken by the headquarters staff of the Corps were, in
many respects, much more onerous than those which fall to the lot of
a similar establishment in Great Britain, and comprised not only the
routine work of the brigade, but also very many functions which under
home conditions would have been assumed by either the War Office or
the Air Ministry.

Looking back at the past two years, it appears that although the
headquarters burden was thus increased, the arrangement proved
distinctly to the advantage of the Corps, resulting as it did in
the centralization of authority and a constant unity of purpose and
procedure which otherwise would have been difficult of achievement.
