The “crash” diagram is, after all, the most definite and conclusive
record of the success or failure of any system of flying instruction.
Its facts are incontrovertible.

During the earlier period of the history of the Corps in Canada,
there was, of course, in use a constantly broadening system whereby
the details of all aerial accidents were instantly forwarded to
headquarters. It was not, however, until the Armour Heights method
had been in definite operation for some months that it became
possible to re-analyse the then existing procedure in the light
of new knowledge, and evolve a form of records which completely
reflected all the various instrumentalities which required diagnosis.

This statement carries no reflection on either the instructors or
the methods of instruction pertaining to the first year’s operation
of the unit. As in all its other activities, out of experience
came knowledge, the application of which was instantly undertaken.
We find, then, that during the summer of 1918 not only were the
salient features of the crash carefully investigated, but also all
those possibly contributory causes in some one of which will almost
certainly be found some vitally important feature.

The first procedure was to classify the crash. The method adopted
will be seen in the index of the graph on page 229. Prior, however,
to this classification, which of course is only established by means
of close technical examination of the damaged machine, the unit to
which the machine belonged sent to headquarters by telegraph or
telephone, whichever was the faster, the following information:--

(1) Regimental number, rank and name of personnel concerned,
stating which is pilot and which is passenger.

(2) Injuries sustained and by whom.

(3) Précis of accident.

(4) Time and date.

(5) Type and number of machine.

(6) Number of hours solo and dual flown by casualty.

(7) Whether next-of-kin has been notified.

(8) Whether Canadian press (if necessary) has been notified.
