Reference has been made elsewhere to the excellent service given by
the Curtiss engine and Canadian JN4 aeroplane. This machine became
out of date a little later, but such were its qualifications of
strength and manoeuvring capacity, that, during the more recent
period of the work of the brigade all pilots were sent overseas with
flying instruction practically complete, needing only an introduction
to machines, which although faster and more modern, were able to
perform few manoeuvres which had not already been done on the JN4.

Owing to the fact that one-half of the personnel of the brigade was
in a constant state of flux, and moving forward from unit to unit,
additional work was thrown upon both the Records and Quartermaster’s
department, and the prompt manner in which these organizations
adapted themselves to the changing needs is worthy of mention.
The move to Texas created an involved situation which was made
workable only by a very special effort and complete coöperation
with the Imperial Munitions Board, and, in spite of the strain thus
occasioned, the success of this move must always be recalled with
particular satisfaction by those responsible for its arrangement.

The Quartermaster branch discharged, as well, the duty of a
Quartermaster-General’s department, this being but one instance
out of many in which the obligations of individual sections of
the brigade were enlarged till they paralleled the work elsewhere
performed by the Air Board or the War Office.
