The Wright Brothers' Aeroplane

_By Orville and Wilbur Wright_


Though the subject of aerial navigation is generally considered new, it
has occupied the minds of men more or less from the earliest ages. Our
personal interest in it dates from our childhood days. Late in the
autumn of 1878 our father came into the house one evening with some
object partly concealed in his hands, and before we could see what it
was, he tossed it into the air. Instead of falling to the floor, as we
expected, it flew across the room, till it struck the ceiling, where it
fluttered awhile, and finally sank to the floor. It was a little toy,
known to scientists as a "helicoptere," but which we, with sublime
disregard for science, at once dubbed a "bat." It was a light frame of
cork and bamboo, covered with paper, which formed two screws, driven in
opposite directions by rubber bands under torsion. A toy so delicate
lasted only a short time in the hands of small boys, but its memory was
abiding.
