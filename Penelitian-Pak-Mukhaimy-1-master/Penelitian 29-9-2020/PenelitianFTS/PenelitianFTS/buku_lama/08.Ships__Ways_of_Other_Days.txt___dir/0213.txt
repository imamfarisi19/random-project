[30] Stow.

[31] “No nearer”--“don’t come any nearer to the wind.”

[32] “Thou failest”--“you’re slacking.”

[36] “Thow canst no whery” = “you mustn’t complain”--“you know nothing
about these matters.”

[37] Malmsey.

[38] Boiled nor roast.

[39] “My head will be cleft in three”--“my head is splitting.”

[48] i.e. lie to a drift-sail or sea-anchor.

[49] i.e. an azimuth compass.

[50] This is thought to have been some instrument showing how the line
of the course cuts the several meridians, those meridians being drawn
upon their proper inclination.

[51] The derivation of the word _Flame_-borough or Flamborough at once
suggests a burning beacon.
