“And your sprat?”

“Got him,” answered the Assistant Commissioner with a concision which did
not mean to be repellent in the least.

“Good.  You’ve no idea how these great men dislike to be disappointed in
small things.”

After this profound observation the experienced Toodles seemed to
reflect.  At any rate he said nothing for quite two seconds.  Then:

“I’m glad.  But—I say—is it really such a very small thing as you make it
out?”

“Do you know what may be done with a sprat?” the Assistant Commissioner
asked in his turn.

“He’s sometimes put into a sardine box,” chuckled Toodles, whose
erudition on the subject of the fishing industry was fresh and, in
comparison with his ignorance of all other industrial matters, immense.
“There are sardine canneries on the Spanish coast which—”

The Assistant Commissioner interrupted the apprentice statesman.

“Yes.  Yes.  But a sprat is also thrown away sometimes in order to catch
a whale.”

“A whale.  Phew!” exclaimed Toodles, with bated breath.  “You’re after a
whale, then?”

“Not exactly.  What I am after is more like a dog-fish.  You don’t know
perhaps what a dog-fish is like.”

“Yes; I do.  We’re buried in special books up to our necks—whole shelves
full of them—with plates. . . . It’s a noxious, rascally-looking,
altogether detestable beast, with a sort of smooth face and moustaches.”

“Described to a T,” commended the Assistant Commissioner.  “Only mine is
clean-shaven altogether.  You’ve seen him.  It’s a witty fish.”

“I have seen him!” said Toodles incredulously.  “I can’t conceive where I
could have seen him.”

“At the Explorers, I should say,” dropped the Assistant Commissioner
calmly.  At the name of that extremely exclusive club Toodles looked
scared, and stopped short.

“Nonsense,” he protested, but in an awe-struck tone.  “What do you mean?
A member?”

“Honorary,” muttered the Assistant Commissioner through his teeth.

“Heavens!”

Toodles looked so thunderstruck that the Assistant Commissioner smiled
faintly.
