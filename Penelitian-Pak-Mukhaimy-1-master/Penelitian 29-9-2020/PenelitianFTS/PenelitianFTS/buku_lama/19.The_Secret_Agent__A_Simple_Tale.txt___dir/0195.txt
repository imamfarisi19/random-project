“You must hide me till the morning somewhere,” she said in a dismayed
voice.

“Fact is, my dear, I can’t take you where I live.  I share the room with
a friend.”

He was somewhat dismayed himself.  In the morning the blessed ’tecs will
be out in all the stations, no doubt.  And if they once got hold of her,
for one reason or another she would be lost to him indeed.

“But you must.  Don’t you care for me at all—at all?  What are you
thinking of?”

She said this violently, but she let her clasped hands fall in
discouragement.  There was a silence, while the mist fell, and darkness
reigned undisturbed over Brett Place.  Not a soul, not even the vagabond,
lawless, and amorous soul of a cat, came near the man and the woman
facing each other.

“It would be possible perhaps to find a safe lodging somewhere,” Ossipon
spoke at last.  “But the truth is, my dear, I have not enough money to go
and try with—only a few pence.  We revolutionists are not rich.”

He had fifteen shillings in his pocket.  He added:

“And there’s the journey before us, too—first thing in the morning at
that.”

She did not move, made no sound, and Comrade Ossipon’s heart sank a
little.  Apparently she had no suggestion to offer.  Suddenly she
clutched at her breast, as if she had felt a sharp pain there.

“But I have,” she gasped.  “I have the money.  I have enough money.  Tom!
Let us go from here.”

“How much have you got?” he inquired, without stirring to her tug; for he
was a cautious man.

“I have the money, I tell you.  All the money.”

“What do you mean by it?  All the money there was in the bank, or what?”
he asked incredulously, but ready not to be surprised at anything in the
way of luck.

“Yes, yes!” she said nervously.  “All there was.  I’ve it all.”

“How on earth did you manage to get hold of it already?” he marvelled.

“He gave it to me,” she murmured, suddenly subdued and trembling.
Comrade Ossipon put down his rising surprise with a firm hand.
