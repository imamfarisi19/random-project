“I suppose you recognise this?”

She took it mechanically in both her hands.  Her eyes seemed to grow
bigger as she looked.

“Yes,” she whispered, then raised her head, and staggered backward a
little.

“Whatever for is it torn out like this?”

The Chief Inspector snatched across the counter the cloth out of her
hands, and she sat heavily on the chair.  He thought: identification’s
perfect.  And in that moment he had a glimpse into the whole amazing
truth.  Verloc was the “other man.”

“Mrs Verloc,” he said, “it strikes me that you know more of this bomb
affair than even you yourself are aware of.”

Mrs Verloc sat still, amazed, lost in boundless astonishment.  What was
the connection?  And she became so rigid all over that she was not able
to turn her head at the clatter of the bell, which caused the private
investigator Heat to spin round on his heel.  Mr Verloc had shut the
door, and for a moment the two men looked at each other.

Mr Verloc, without looking at his wife, walked up to the Chief Inspector,
who was relieved to see him return alone.

“You here!” muttered Mr Verloc heavily.  “Who are you after?”

“No one,” said Chief Inspector Heat in a low tone.  “Look here, I would
like a word or two with you.”

Mr Verloc, still pale, had brought an air of resolution with him.  Still
he didn’t look at his wife.  He said:

“Come in here, then.”  And he led the way into the parlour.

The door was hardly shut when Mrs Verloc, jumping up from the chair, ran
to it as if to fling it open, but instead of doing so fell on her knees,
with her ear to the keyhole.  The two men must have stopped directly they
were through, because she heard plainly the Chief Inspector’s voice,
though she could not see his finger pressed against her husband’s breast
emphatically.

“You are the other man, Verloc.  Two men were seen entering the park.”

And the voice of Mr Verloc said:

“Well, take me now.  What’s to prevent you?  You have the right.”
