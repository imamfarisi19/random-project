“My husband will see you through all right.  Meantime for a few days you
couldn’t do better than take lodgings with Mr Giugliani.  Continental
Hotel it’s called.  Private.  It’s quiet.  My husband will take you
there.”

“A good idea,” said the thin, dark man, whose glance had hardened
suddenly.

“You knew Mr Verloc before—didn’t you?  Perhaps in France?”

“I have heard of him,” admitted the visitor in his slow, painstaking
tone, which yet had a certain curtness of intention.

There was a pause.  Then he spoke again, in a far less elaborate manner.
