The old woman raised a wail again.

“And, my dear, I must see that poor boy every Sunday.  He won’t mind
spending the day with his old mother—”

Winnie screamed out stolidly:

“Mind!  I should think not.  That poor boy will miss you something cruel.
I wish you had thought a little of that, mother.”

Not think of it!  The heroic woman swallowed a playful and inconvenient
object like a billiard ball, which had tried to jump out of her throat.
Winnie sat mute for a while, pouting at the front of the cab, then
snapped out, which was an unusual tone with her:

“I expect I’ll have a job with him at first, he’ll be that restless—”

“Whatever you do, don’t let him worry your husband, my dear.”

Thus they discussed on familiar lines the bearings of a new situation.
And the cab jolted.  Mrs Verloc’s mother expressed some misgivings.
Could Stevie be trusted to come all that way alone?  Winnie maintained
that he was much less “absent-minded” now.  They agreed as to that.  It
could not be denied.  Much less—hardly at all.  They shouted at each
other in the jingle with comparative cheerfulness.  But suddenly the
maternal anxiety broke out afresh.  There were two omnibuses to take, and
a short walk between.  It was too difficult!  The old woman gave way to
grief and consternation.

Winnie stared forward.

“Don’t you upset yourself like this, mother.  You must see him, of
course.”

“No, my dear.  I’ll try not to.”

She mopped her streaming eyes.

“But you can’t spare the time to come with him, and if he should forget
himself and lose his way and somebody spoke to him sharply, his name and
address may slip his memory, and he’ll remain lost for days and days—”

The vision of a workhouse infirmary for poor Stevie—if only during
inquiries—wrung her heart.  For she was a proud woman.  Winnie’s stare
had grown hard, intent, inventive.

“I can’t bring him to you myself every week,” she cried.  “But don’t you
worry, mother.  I’ll see to it that he don’t get lost for long.”
