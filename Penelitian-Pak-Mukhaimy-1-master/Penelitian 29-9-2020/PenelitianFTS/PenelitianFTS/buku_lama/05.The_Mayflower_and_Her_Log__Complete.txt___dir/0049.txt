Sharpe.  Was also a friend of both Pilgrim and Puritan. He came to New
England in 1629, and settled first at Salem, in the Massachusetts
Company.  He died in 1658, having long been a ruling elder of the
church there.  He met with many enemies, but was a valuable man and
an able one.  He was Governor Cradock�s New England agent.

Shirley.  Requires little mention here.  The perfidious friend of the
Pilgrims,--perhaps originally true to them,--he sunk everything for
hope of gain.  He was treasurer of the Adventurers, one of their
most active and intelligent men, but proved a rascal and a canting
hypocrite.  He was a �citizen and gold-smith� of London.

Thomas.  Has nowhere been enumerated in any list of the Adventurers
(though occasionally mentioned as such by recent writers), which is
strange, as repeated letters of his to Bradford, and other data,
show him to have been one of the best and truest of them all.  He
sold his interests before the �Composition� and became a colonist
after 1630.  He was the fifth of the Adventurers to come to New
England to remain, and cast in his lot with the Pilgrims at New
Plimoth--Martin, Mullens, Collier, and Hatherly preceding him.  A
wealthy and well-informed man, he became a power in the government.
Probably Welsh by birth, he was a London merchant when the
Adventurers were organized.  His home at Marshfield, Massachusetts,
has since become additionally famous as the home of Daniel Webster.

Thornell (John).  Is sometimes confounded with another Adventurer,
Matthew Thornhill, as his name is some times so spelled.  There is
reason to believe they were related.  He was not a friend to the
Pilgrims.

Thornhill (or Thornell), (Matthew).  Little is known concerning him.

Tilden.  Was of an old family in Kent, �a citizen and girdler of London,�
as his will declares, his brother (Nathaniel) later coming to New
England and settling near Hatherly at Scituate.  Nathaniel�s son
Joseph--named for his uncle--was made his executor and heir.  The
uncle was always a firm friend of the Pilgrims.  Mr. Tilden�s will
is given by Waters (�Genealogical Gleanings,� vol. i.  p. 71), and
is of much interest.
