William Butten (who died at sea, November 6/16), Bradford calls
�a youth.�  He was undoubtedly a �servant�-assistant to the doctor.

Isaac Allerton, it is a fair assumption, was about thirty-four in 1620,
from the fact that he married his first wife October 4, 1611, as he
was called �a young man� in the Leyden marriage record.  He is
called �of London, England,� by Bradford and on the Leyden records.
He was made a �freeman� of Leyden, February 7, 1614.  Arber and
others state that his early occupation was that of �tailor,� but he
was later a tradesman and merchant.

Mary (Norris) Allerton is called a �maid of Newbury in England,� in the
Leyden record of her marriage, in October, 1611, and it is the only
hint as to her age we have.  She was presumably a young woman.  Her
death followed (a month later) the birth of her still-born son, on
board the MAY-FLOWER in Plymouth harbor, February 25/March 7, 1621.

Bartholomew Allerton, born probably in 1612/13 (his parents married
October, 1611), was hence, as stated, about seven or eight years old
at the embarkation.  He has been represented as older, but this was
clearly impossible.  He was doubtless born in Holland.

Remember Allerton, apparently Allerton�s second child, has (with a
novelist�s license) been represented by Mrs. Austin as considerably
older than six, in fact nearer sixteen (Goodwin, p. 183, says,
�over 13�), but the known years of her mother�s marriage and her
brother�s birth make this improbable.  She was, no doubt, born in
Holland about 1614--She married Moses Maverick by 1635, and Thomas
Weston�s only child, Elizabeth, was married from her house at
Marblehead to Roger Conant, son of the first �governor� of a
Massachusetts Bay �plantation.�

Mary Allerton, apparently the third child, could hardly have been much
more than four years old in 1620, though Goodwin (�Pilgrim
Republic,� p.  184) calls her eleven, which is an error.  She was
probably born in Holland about 1616.  She was the last survivor of
the passengers of the MAY-FLOWER, dying at Plymouth, New England,
1699.
