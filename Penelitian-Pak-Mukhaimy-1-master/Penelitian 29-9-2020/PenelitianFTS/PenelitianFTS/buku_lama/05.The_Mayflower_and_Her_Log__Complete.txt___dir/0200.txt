You shall here distinctly by John Turner, who I thinke shall come hence
on tewsday night.  I had thought to have come with him, to have answered
to my complaints; but I shal lerne to pass litle for their censurs; and
if I had more minde to goe & dispute & expostulate with them, then I have
care of this waightie bussines, I were like them who live by clamours &
jangling.  But neither my mind nor my body is at libertie to doe much,
for I am fettered with bussines, and had rather study to be quiet, then
to make answer to their exceptions.  If men be set on it, let them beat
ye eair; I hope such as are my sinceire freinds will not thinke but I can
give some reason of my actions.  But of your mistaking aboute ye mater,
& other things tending to this bussines, I shall nexte informe you
more distinctly.  Mean space entreate our freinds not to be too bussie in
answering matters, before they know them.  If I doe such things as I
canot give reasons for, it is like you have sett a foole aboute your
bussines, and so turne ye reproofe to your selves, & send an other, and
let me come againe to my Combes.  But setting aside my naturall
infirmities, I refuse not to have my cause judged, both of God, & all
indifferent men; and when we come togeather I shall give accounte of my
actions hear.  The Lord, who judgeth justly without respect of persons,
see into ye equitie of my cause, and give us quiet, peacable, and patient
minds, in all these turmoils, and sanctifie unto us all crosses
whatsoever.  And so I take my leave of you all, in all love & affection.
I hope we shall gett all hear ready in 14. days.
Your pore brother,
ROBART CUSHMAN.

A LETTER OF MR. JOHN ROBINSON TO JOHN CARVER,
JUNE 14. (N.S.), 1620

[Professor Arber (�The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers,� p. 317) has
apparently failed to notice that in the original MS. of Bradford,
this letter is dated �June 14, 1620, N. Stile,� which would make it
June 4., O.S., while Arber dates it �14/24 June,� which is
manifestly incorrect.  A typographical error in Arber (p. 317)
directs the letter to �Leyden� instead of to London. ]
