Moses Fletcher was of the Leyden company, a �smith,� and at the time of
his second marriage at Leyden, November 30/December 21, 1613, was
called a �widower� and �of England.�  As he was probably of age at
the time of his first marriage,--presumably two years or more before
his last,--he must have been over thirty in 1620.  He was perhaps
again a widower when he came over, as no mention is made of his
having wife or family.  He was possibly of the Amsterdam family of
that name.  His early death was a great loss to the colony.

A Thomas Williams is mentioned by Hon. Henry C  Murphy (�Historical
Magazine,� vol. iii.  pp. 358, 359), in a list of some of Robinson�s
congregation who did not go to New England in either the MAY-FLOWER,
FORTUNE, ANNE, Or LITTLE JAMES.  He either overlooked the fact that
Williams was one of the MAY-FLOWER passengers, or else there were
two of the name, one of whom did not go.  Nothing is known of the
age or former history of the Pilgrim of that name.  He died in the
spring of 1621 (before the end of March). As he signed the Compact,
he must have been over twenty-one.  He may have left a wife, Sarah.

John Goodman we know little more about than that he and Peter Browne seem
to have been �lost� together, on one occasion (when he was badly
frozen), and to have had, with his little spaniel dog, a rencontre
with �two great wolves,� on another.  He was twice married, the last
time at Leyden in 1619.  He died before the end of March, 1621.
As he signed the Compact, he must have been over twenty-one.

Edward Margeson we know nothing about.  As he signed the Compact, he was
presumably of age.

Richard Britteridge affords little data.  His age, birthplace, or
occupation do not transpire, but he was, it seems, according to
Bradford, the first of the company to die on board the ship after
she had cast anchor in the harbor of New Plymouth.  This fact
negatives the pleasant fiction of Mrs. Austin�s �Standish of
Standish� (p. 104), that Britteridge was one of those employed in
cutting sedge on shore on Friday, January 12.  Poor Britteridge died
December 21, three weeks earlier.  He signed the Compact, and hence
may be accounted of age at the landing at Cape Cod.
