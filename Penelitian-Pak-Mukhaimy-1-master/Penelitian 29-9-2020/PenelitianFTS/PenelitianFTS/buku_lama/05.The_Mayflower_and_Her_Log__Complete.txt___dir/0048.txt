Newbald.  Finds no especial mention.

Pennington.  Appears only as a signer.  It is a London name.

Penrin.  Appears only as a signer of the �Composition.�

Pickering.  Is introduced to us first as a Leyden merchant, through John
Robinson�s letters.  He appears to have been a shrewd, cold-blooded
calculator, like his partner-Adventurer, Greene, not interested
especially in the Pilgrims, except for gain, and soon deserting the
Adventurers.  His family seem to have been in favor with Charles II.
(See Pepys� �Diary.�)

Pierce (John).  Although recognized by the Virginia Companies and Council
for New England, as the representative of the Adventurers, he has
only been recently generally reckoned a chief man of the
Adventurers. A Protean friend of the Pilgrims, never reliable, ever
pretentious, always self-seeking, and of no help. He was finally
ruined by the disasters to his ship, the PARAGON, which cost him all
his interests.  Having attempted treacherously to secure to himself
the Patent granted in the Colony�s interest, he was compelled by the
Council to surrender its advantages to the Adventurers and
colonists.

Pocock.  Was a stanch and firm supporter of the Pilgrims and their
interests, at all times, and to the end.  He was also a financial
supporter and deputy-governor  the Massachusetts Company, under
Winthrop.  A correspondent of Bradford.  A good man.

Poyton.  Finds no especial mention.  He appears as a signer only.

Quarles.  Appears only as a signer of the �Composition.�

Revell.  Was a very wealthy citizen, merchant, and ship owner of London,
and a good man.  He became also ardently interested in Winthrop�s
Company.  Was an �assistant� and one of the five �undertakers�
chosen to go to New England to reside.  He went to New England on
the JEWELL of Winthrop�s fleet, and was part owner of the LADY
ARBELLA.  He evidently, however, did not like the life, and returned
after a few weeks� stay.

Rookes.  Appears only as a signer.
