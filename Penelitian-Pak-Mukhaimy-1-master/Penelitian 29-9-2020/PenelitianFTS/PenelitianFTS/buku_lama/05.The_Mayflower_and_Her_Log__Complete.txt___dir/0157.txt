The fact is that the Pilgrims did not assent to the new conditions,
unwarrantably imposed by Weston, though of small consequence in any
view of the case, until Cushman came over to New Plymouth in the
FORTUNE, in 1621, and by dint of his sermon on the �Sin and Danger
of Self-Love,� and his persuasion, induced them (they being also
advised thereto by Robinson) to sign them.  All business up to this
time had been done between the Adventurers and the Pilgrims,
apparently, without any agreement in writing.  It was probably felt,
both by Robinson and the Plymouth leaders, that it was the least
reparation they could make Cushman for their cruel and unjust
treatment of him, realizing at length that, through all
vicissitudes, he had proven their just, sagacious, faithful, and
efficient friend.  There does not appear to be any conclusive
evidence that any articles of agreement between the Adventurers and
colonists were signed before the MAY-FLOWER Sailed.]

case, which they did.  Landed some three
score firkins of butter,  sold as
determined.
