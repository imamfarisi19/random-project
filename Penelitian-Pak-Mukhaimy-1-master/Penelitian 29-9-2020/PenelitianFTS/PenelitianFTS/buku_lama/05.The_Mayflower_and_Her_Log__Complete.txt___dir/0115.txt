Governor Edward Winslow�s known age at his death fixes his age at the
time of the exodus, and his birth is duly recorded at Droitwich, in
Worcester, England. (See �Winslow Memorial,� David Parsons Holton,
vol. i.  p. 16.)

Mrs. Elizabeth (Barker) Winslow, the first wife of the Governor, appears
by the data supplied by the record of her marriage in Holland, May
27, 1618, to have been a maiden of comporting years to her
husband�s, he being then twenty-three.  Tradition makes her slightly
younger than her husband.

George Soule, it is evident,--like Howland,--though denominated a
�servant� by Bradford, was more than this, and should rather have
been styled, as Goodwin points out, �an employee� of Edward Winslow.
His age is approximated by collateral evidence, his marriage, etc.

Elias Story is called �man-servant� by Bradford, and his age is unknown.
The fact that he did not sign the Compact indicates that he was
under age, but extreme illness may have prevented, as he died early.

Ellen More, �a little girl that was put to him� (Winslow), died early.
She was sister of the other More children, �bound out� to Carver and
Brewster, of whom extended mention has been made.

Governor William Bradford�s date of birth fixes his age in 1620.  His
early home was at Austerfield, in Yorkshire.  Belknap (�American
Biography,� vol. ii.  p. 218) says: �He learned the art of
silk-dyeing.�

Mrs. Dorothy (May) Bradford�s age (the first wife of the Governor) is
fixed at twenty-three by collateral data, but she may have been
older.  She was probably from Wisbeach, England.  The manner of her
tragic death (by drowning, having fallen overboard from the ship in
Cape Cod harbor), the first violent death in the colony, was
especially sad, her husband being absent for a week afterward.  It
is not known that her body was recovered.

Dr. Samuel Fuller, from his marriage record at Leyden, made in 1613, when
he was a widower, it is fair to assume was about thirty, perhaps
older, in 1620, as he could, when married, have hardly been under
twenty-one.  His (third) wife and child were left in Holland.
