FRIDAY, Dec. 8/18
At anchor in harbor.  A strong south-east
gale with heavy rain, turning to snow and
growing cold toward night, as it cleared.
This day Master James Chilton died aboard
the ship.  The third passenger, and first
head of a family; to die in this harbor.

SATURDAY, Dec. 9/19
At anchor in harbor.  Burying-party sent
ashore after services aboard, to bury
Chilton.  Fetched wood and water.


[The death of Chilton was the first of the head of a family, and it
may readily be imagined that the burial was an especially affecting
scene, especially as following so closely upon the tragic death of
Mrs. Bradford (for whom no funeral or burial arrangements are
mentioned??  D.W.)]

SUNDAY, Dec. 10/20
At anchor in Cape Cod harbor.  The fifth
Sunday in this harbor.  The exploring party
still absent.  Four deaths one by drowning;
very severe weather; the ship�s narrow
escape from being blown up; and the absence
of so many of the principal men, have made
it a hard, gloomy week.

MONDAY, Dec. 11/21
At anchor in harbor.  Clear weather.

TUESDAY, Dec. 12/22
At anchor in harbor.  Exploration party
still absent.

WEDNESDAY, Dec. 13/23
At anchor in harbor.  Exploration party
returned to ship, where much sad
intelligence met them (especially Master
Bradford), as to his wife�s drowning.  The
exploring party report finding a
considerable Indian burying-place; several
Indian houses; a fierce attack on them by
Indians on Friday morning, but without
harm; a severe gale on the same afternoon,
in which their rudder-hinges broke,  their
mast was split in three pieces, their sail
fell over board in a heavy sea, and they
were like to have been cast away in making
a harbor which Master Coppin thought he
knew, but was deceived about.  They landed
on an island at the mouth of the harbor,
which they named for Master Clarke, the
first mate, and spent Saturday and Sunday
there, and on Monday examined the harbor
they found, and are agreed that it is the
place for settlement.  Much satisfaction
with the report among the colonists.
