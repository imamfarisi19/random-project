The provisions in use, both by passengers and crew, were probably kept in
the lazarette or �runs,� in the stern of the ship, which would be
unusually capacious in vessels of this model; some--the bulkiest--in the
hold under the forward hatch, as the custom was, and to some extent still
is. The food supply of the Pilgrims, constituting part of the
MAY-FLOWER�S Cargo, included, as appears from authentic sources:--

Breadstuff�s, including,--
Biscuits or ship-bread (in barrels).
Oatmeal (in barrels or hogsheads).
Rye meal (in hogsheads).
Butter (in firkins).
Cheese, �Hollands� and English (in boxes).
Eggs, pickled (in tubs).
Fish, �haberdyne� [or salt dried cod] (in boxes).
Smoked herring (in boxes).
Meats, including,--
Beef, salt, or �corned� (in barrels).
Dry-salted (in barrels).
Smoked (in sacks).
Dried neats�-tongues (in boxes).
Pork, bacon, smoked (in sacks or boxes).
Salt [�corned�] (in barrels).
Hams and shoulders, smoked (in canvas sacks or hogsheads).
Salt (in bags and barrels).
Vegetables, including,--
Beans (in bags and barrels).
Cabbages (in sacks and barrels).
Onions (in sacks).
Turnips (in sacks).
Parsnips (in sacks).
Pease (in barrels), and
Vinegar (in hogsheads), while,--
Beer (in casks), brandy, �aqua vitae� (in pipes), and gin [�Hollands,�
�strong waters,� or �schnapps�] (in pipes) were no small or
unimportant part, from any point of view, of the provision supply.

Winslow, in his letter to George Morton advising him as to his
preparations for the voyage over, says: �Be careful to have a very good
bread-room to keep your biscuit in.�  This was to keep them from
dampness.  Winthrop gives us the memorandum of his order for the
ship-bread for his voyage in 1630.  He says: �Agreed with Keene of
Southwark, baker, for 20,000 of Biscuit, 15,000 of brown, and 5,000 of
white.� Captain Beecher minutes: �10 M. of bread for the ship ARBELLA.�
Beecher�s memorandum of �oatmeal� is �30 bushels.�  Winslow mentions
�oatmeal,� and Winthrop notes among the provisions bought by Captain
William Pierce, �4 hhds. of oatmeal.�  Rye meal was usually meant by the
term �meal,� and Window in his letter to George Morton advises him: �Let
your meal be so hard-trod in your casks that you shall need an adz or
hatchet to work it out with;� and also to �be careful to come by [be
able to get at] some of your meal to spend [use] by the way.�
Notwithstanding that Bradford� speaks of their �selling away� some �60
firkins of butter,� to clear port charges at Southampton, and the
leaders, in their letter to the Adventurers from that port (August 3),
speak of themselves, when leaving Southampton in August, 1620, as
�scarce having any butter,� there seems to have been some left to give
as a present to Quadrequina, Massasoit�s brother, the last of March
following, which would indicate its good �keeping� qualities.  Wood, in
his �New England�s Prospect� (ch. 2), says: �Their butter and cheese
were corrupted.�  Bradford mentions that their lunch on the exploration
expedition of November 15, on Cape Cod, included �Hollands cheese,�
which receives also other mention.  There is a single mention, in the
literature of the day, of eggs preserved in salt, for use on shipboard.
�Haberdyne� (or dried salt cod) seems to have been a favorite and staple
article of diet aboard ship. Captain Beecher minutes �600 haberdyne for
the ship ARBELLA.� Wood says: �Their fish was rotten.�  Smoked
�red-herring� were familiar food to all the MAY-FLOWER company.  No
house or ship of England or Holland in that day but made great
dependence upon them.  Bacon was, of course, a main staple at sea.  In
its half-cooked state as it came from the smoke-house it was much
relished with their biscuit by seamen and others wishing strong food,
and when fried it became a desirable article of food to all except the
sick.  Mention is made of it by several of the early Pilgrim writers.
Carlyle, as quoted, speaks of it as a diet-staple on the MAY-FLOWER.
Salt (�corned�) beef has always been a main article of food with seamen
everywhere.  Wood� states that the �beef� of the Pilgrims was �tainted.�
In some way it was made the basis of a reputedly palatable preparation
called �spiced beef,� mentioned as prepared by one of the sailors for a
shipmate dying on the MAY-FLOWER in Plymouth harbor. It must have been a
very different article from that we now find so acceptable under that
name in England. Winthrop� gives the price of his beef at �19 shillings
per cwt.� Winslow advises his friend Morton, in the letter so often
quoted, not to have his beef �dry-salted,� saying, �none can do it
better than the sailors,� which is a suggestion not readily understood.
�Smoked� beef was practically the same as that known as �jerked,�
�smoked,� or �dried� beef in America.  A �dried neat�s-tongue� is named
as a contribution of the Pilgrims to the dinner for Captain Jones and
his men on February 21, 1621, when they had helped to draw up and mount
the cannon upon the platform on the hill at Plymouth. Winthrop paid
�14d. a piece� for his �neats� tongues.�  The pork of the Pilgrims is
also said by Wood� to have been �tainted.�  Winthrop states that his
pork cost �20 pence the stone� (14 lbs.).
