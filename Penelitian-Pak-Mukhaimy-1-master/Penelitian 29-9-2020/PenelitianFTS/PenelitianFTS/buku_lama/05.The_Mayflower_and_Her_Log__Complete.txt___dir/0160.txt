[Goodwin notes (Pilgrim Republic, p. 57) that �it was fortunate for
the overloaded MAY-FLOWER that she had fine weather while lying at
anchor there, .  .  .  for the port of Plymouth was then only a
shallow, open bay, with no protection.  In southwesterly gales its
waters rose into enormous waves, with such depressions between that
ships while anchored sometimes struck the bottom of the harbor and
were dashed in pieces.�]
