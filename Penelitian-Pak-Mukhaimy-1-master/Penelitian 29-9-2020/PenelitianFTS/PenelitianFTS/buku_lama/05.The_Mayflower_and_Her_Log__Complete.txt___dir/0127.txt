Richard Clarke appears only as one of the passengers and as dying before
the end of March.  He signed the Compact, and hence was doubtless
twenty-one or over.

Richard Gardiner, we know from Bradford, �became a seaman and died in
England or at sea.�  He was evidently a young man, but of his age or
antecedents nothing appears.  He signed the Compact, and hence was
at least twenty-one years old.

John Alderton (sometimes spelled Allerton), we are told by Bradford,--as
elsewhere noted,--�was hired, but was reputed one of the company,
but was to go back, being a seaman and so, presumably, unmindful of
the voyages, for the help of others.�  Whether Bradford intended by
the latter clause to indicate that he had left his family behind,
and came �to spy out the land,� and, if satisfied, to return for
them, or was to return for the counsel and assistance of Robinson
and the rest, who were to follow, is not clear, but the latter view
has most to support it.  We learn his occupation, but can only infer
that he was a young man over twenty-one from the above and the fact
that he signed the Compact.  It has been suggested that he was a
relative of Isaac Allerton, but this is nowhere shown and is
improbable.  He died before the MAY-FLOWER returned to England.

Thomas English (or Enlish), Bradford tells us (�Historie,� Mass. ed.
p. 533), �was hired to goe Master of a [the] shallop here.�  He,
however, �died here before the ship returned.�  It is altogether
probable that he was the savior of the colony on that stormy night
when the shallop made Plymouth harbor the first time, and, narrowly
escaping destruction, took shelter under Clarke�s Island.  The first
three governors of the colony, its chief founders,--Carver,
Bradford, and Winslow,--with Standish, Warren, Hopkins, Howland,
Dotey, and others, were on board, and but for the heroism and prompt
action of �the lusty sea man which steered,� who was--beyond
reasonable doubt--English, as Bradford�s narrative (�Morton�s
Memorial�) shows, the lives of the entire party must, apparently,
have been lost.  That English was, if on board--Bradford shows in
the �Memorial� that he was--as Master of the shallop, properly her
helmsman in so critical a time, goes without saying, especially as
the �rudder was broken� and an oar substituted; that the ship�s
�mates,� Clarke and Coppin, were not in charge (although on board)
fully appears by Bradford�s account; and as it must have taken all
of the other (four) seamen on board to pull the shallop, bereft of
her sail, in the heavy breakers into which she had been run by
Coppin�s blunder, there would be no seaman but English for the
steering-oar, which was his by right.  Had these leaders been lost
at this critical time,--before a settlement had been made,--it is
certain that the colony must have been abandoned, and the Pilgrim
impress upon America must have been lost.  English�s name should, by
virtue of his great service, be ever held in high honor by all of
Pilgrim stock.  His early death was a grave loss. Bradford spells
the name once Enlish, but presumably by error.  He signed the
Compact as Thomas English.
