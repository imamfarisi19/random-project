discovered that could not speak with them.
The first natives actually seen since the
encounter on the Cape.

[Bradford, Historie, p. 92; Young, Chronicler, p. 198.  Bradford
says (op. cit.  Mass. ed, pp. 120, 121): �The reason on their parts
why she stayed so long was ye necessitie and danger that lay upon
them, for it was well toward ye ende of December before she could
land anything here, or they able to receive anything ashore.  After
wards, ye 14 of January the house which they had made for a general
randevoze by casulty fell afire, and some were faine to retire
aboard for shelter.  Then the sickness begane to fall sore amongst
them, and ye weather so bad as they could not make much sooner
dispatch.  Againe, the Governor & chiefe of them seeing so many dye,
and fall down sick dayly, thought it no wisdom to send away the
ship, their condition considered, and the danger they stood in from
ye Indians, till they could procure some shelter; and therefore
thought it better to draw some more charge upon themselves & friends
[�demurrage?�] than hazard all.  The Mr. and sea-men likewise;
though before they hasted ye passengers a shore to be goone [gone],
now many of their men being dead, and of ye ablest of them [as is
before noted, and of ye rest many lay sick & weake, ye Mr, durst not
put to sea till he saw his men begine to recover, and ye hart of
winter over.�]]
