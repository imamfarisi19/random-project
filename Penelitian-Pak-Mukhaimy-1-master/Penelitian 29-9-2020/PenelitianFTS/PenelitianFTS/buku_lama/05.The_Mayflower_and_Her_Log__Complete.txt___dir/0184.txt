THURSDAY, Feb. 22/Mar. 4
At anchorage.  Large burial-party went
ashore with bodies of Masters Mullens and
White, and joined with those on shore made
the chief burial thus far had.  The service
on shore, the most of the people being
there, Master Mullens being one of the
chief subscribing Adventurers, as well as
one of the chief men of the Planters, as
was Master White.  Their deaths much
deplored.

FRIDAY, Feb. 23/Mar. 5
At anchorage.  Party from the ship went on
shore to help finish work on the ordnance.

SATURDAY, Feb. 24/Mar. 6
At anchorage.  Same.  Fetched wood and
water.

SUNDAY, Feb. 25/Mar. 7
At anchorage in Plymouth harbor.  Eleventh
Sunday in this harbor.  Mistress Mary
Allerton, wife of Master Isaac Allerton,
one of the chief men of the colonists, died
on board this day, not having mended well
since the birth of her child, dead-born
about two months agone.

MONDAY, Feb. 26/Mar. 8
At anchor in harbor.  Burying-party went
ashore to bury Mistress Allerton, services
being held there.

TUESDAY, Feb. 27/Mar. 9
At anchorage.  The sickness and deaths of
the colonists on shore have steadily
increased, and have extended to the ship,
which has lost several of its petty
officers, including the master gunner,
three quarter-masters, and cook, and a
third of the crew, many from scurvy.

[There can be no doubt that both planters and shipï¿½s crew suffered
severely from scurvy.  The conditions all favored it, the sailors
were familiar with it, and would not be likely to be mistaken in
their recognition of it, and Dr. Fuller, their competent physician,
would not be likely to err in his diagnosis of it.  Tuberculosis was
its very natural associate.]

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 28/Mar. 10
At anchorage.  The last day of the month.
The fifty-third day the ship has lain in
this harbor, and from the present rate of
sickness and death aboard, no present
capacity or prospect of getting away, those
better being yet weak.  The Planters have
lost seventeen this month, their largest
mortality.
