Bradford mentions �aqua vitae� as a constituent of their lunch on the
exploring party of November 15.  �Strong waters� (or Holland gin) are
mentioned as a part of the entertainment given Massasoit on his first
visit, and they find frequent mention otherwise.  Wine finds no mention.
Bradford states in terms: �Neither ever had they any supply of foode from
them [the Adventurers] but what they first brought with them;� and again,
�They never had any supply of vitales more afterwards (but what the Lord
gave them otherwise), for all ye company [the Adventurers] sent at any
time was allways too short for those people yt came with it.�

The clothing supplies of the Pilgrims included hats, caps, shirts,
neck-cloths, jerkins, doublets, waistcoats, breeches (stuff and leather),
�hosen,� stockings, shoes, boots, belts (girdles), cloth, piece-goods
(dress-stuff�s), �haberdasherie,� etc., etc., all of which, with minor
items for men�s and women�s use, find mention in their early narratives,
accounts, and correspondence.  By the will of Mr. Mullens it appears that
he had twenty-one dozen of shoes and thirteen pairs of boots on board,
doubtless intended as medium of exchange or barter.  By the terms of the.
contract with the colonists, the Merchant Adventurers were to supply all
their actual necessities of Clothing food, clothing, etc., for the full
term of seven years, during which the labors of the �planters� were to be
for the joint account.  Whether under this agreement they were bound to
fully �outfit� the colonists before they embarked (and did so), as was
done by Higginson�s company coming to Salem in 1628-29 at considerable
cost per capita, and as was done for those of the Leyden people who came
over in 1629 with Pierce in the MAY-FLOWER and the TALBOT to Salem, and
again in 1630 with the same Master (Pierce) in the LION by the Plymouth
successors to the Adventurers (without recompense), does not clearly
appear.  No mention is found of any �outfitting� of the MAY-FLOWER
passengers except the London apprentices.  There is no doubt that a
considerable supply of all the above-named articles was necessarily sent
by the Adventurers on the MAY-FLOWER, both for the Pilgrims� needs on the
voyage and in the new colony, as also for trading purposes.  There seems
to have been at all times a supreme anxiety, on the part of both Pilgrim
and Puritan settlers, to get English clothes upon their red brethren of
the forest, whether as a means of exchange for peltry, or for decency�s
sake, is not quite clear. There was apparently a greater disparity in
character, intelligence, and station between the leaders of Higginson�s
and Winthrop�s companies and their followers than between the chief men
of the Pilgrims and their associates.  With the former were titles and
considerable representation of wealth and position.  With the passengers
of the MAY-FLOWER a far greater equality in rank, means, intelligence,
capacity, and character was noticeable.  This was due in part, doubtless,
to the religious beliefs and training of the Leyden contingent, and had
prompt illustration in their Compact, in which all stood at once on an
equal footing.  There was but little of the �paternal� nature in the form
of their government (though something at times in their punishments), and
there was much personal dignity and independence of the individual.
An equipment having so much of the character of a uniform--not to say
�livery�--as that furnished by Higginson�s company to its people
suggests the �hedger and ditcher� type of colonists (of whom there were
very few among the Plymouth settlers), rather than the scholar,
publisher, tradesman, physician, hatter, smith, carpenter, �lay reader,�
and soldier of the Pilgrims, and would certainly have been obnoxious to
their finer sense of personal dignity and proportion.  Doubtless an
equivalent provision existed--though in less �all-of-a-pattern�
character--in the bales and boxes of the MAY-FLOWER�S cargo for every
need suggested by the list of the Higginson �outfit,� which is given
herewith, both as matter of interest and as affording an excellent idea
of the accepted style and needs in dress of a New England settler (at
least of the men) of 1620-30.  One cannot fail to wonder at the
noticeably infrequent mention of provision in apparel, etc., for the
women and children. The inventory of the �Apparell for 100 men� furnished
by Higginson�s company in 1628-29 gives us, among others, the following
items of clothing for each emigrant:--
4 �peares of shoes.�
4 �peares of stockings.�
1 �peare Norwich gaiters.�
4 �shirts.�
2 �suits dublet and hose of leather lyn�d with oyld skyn leather, ye hose
& dublett with hooks & eyes.�
1 �sute of Norden dussens or hampshire kersies lynd the hose with skins,
dublets with lynen of gilford or gedlyman kerseys.�
4  bands.
2 handkerchiefs.
1 �wastecoat of greene cotton bound about with red tape.�
1 leather girdle.
1 �Monmouth cap.�
1 �black hatt lyned in the brows with lether.�
5 �Red knitt capps milf�d about 5d apiece.�
2 �peares of gloves.�
1 �Mandiliion lynd with cotton� [mantle or greatcoat].
1 �peare of breeches and waistcoat.�
1 �leather sute of Dublett & breeches of oyled leather.�
1 �peare of leather breeches and drawers to weare with both there other
