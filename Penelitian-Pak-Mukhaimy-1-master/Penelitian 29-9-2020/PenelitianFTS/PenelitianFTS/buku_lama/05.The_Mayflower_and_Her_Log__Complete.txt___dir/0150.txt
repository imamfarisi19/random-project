Among the implements of husbandry, etc., and mechanics� tools we find
evidence of hoes, spades, shovels, scythes, �sikles,� mattocks,
bill-hooks, garden-rakes, hay-forks (�pitch-forks�), besides seed-grain
and garden seeds.  Axes, saws, hammers, �adzs,� augers, chisels, gouges,
squares, hatchets, an �iron jack-scrue,� �holdfasts� (vises),
blacksmiths� tools, coopers� tools, iron and steel in bar, anvils,
chains, etc., �staples and locks,� rope, lime (for mortar), nails, etc.,
are also known to have been in the ship.  Francis Eaton, the carpenter,
seems to have had a very respectable �kit,� and Fletcher, the smith, was
evidently fairly �outfitted.�

The implements of husbandry were of the lighter (?) sort; no ploughs,
harrows, carts, harness, stone-drags, or other farming tools requiring
the strength of beasts for their use, were included.  In nothing could
they have experienced so sharp a contrast as in the absence of horses,
cattle, and sheep in their husbandry, and especially of milch kine.
Bradford and Window both mention hoes, spades, mattocks, and sickles,
while shovels, scythes, bill-hooks (brush-scythes, the terrible weapons
of the English peasantry in their great �Mon mouth� and earlier
uprisings), pitchforks, etc., find very early mention in inventories and
colonial records.  Josselyn, in his �Two Voyages to New England,� gives,
in 1628, the following very pertinent list of �Tools for a Family of six
persons, and so after this rate for more,--intending for New England.�
This may be taken as fairly approximating the possessions of the average
MAY-FLOWER planter, though probably somewhat exceeding individual
supplies.  Eight years of the Pilgrims� experience had taught those who
came after them very much that was of service.
