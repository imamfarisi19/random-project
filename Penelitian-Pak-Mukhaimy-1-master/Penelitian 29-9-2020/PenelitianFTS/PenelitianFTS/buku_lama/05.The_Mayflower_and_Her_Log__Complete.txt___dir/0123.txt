John Rigdale and his wife Alice afford no data.  They both died early,
and there is no record concerning either of them beyond the fact
that they were passengers.

Edward Fuller and his wife have left us little record of themselves save
that they were of Leyden, that he is reputed a brother of Dr. Samuel
Fuller (for whom they seem to have named the boy they brought over
with them,--leaving apparently another son, Matthew, behind), and
that both died the first winter.  He must have been at least
twenty-five, judging from the fact that he was married and had two
children, and was perhaps somewhat older (though traditionally
represented as younger) than his brother.  Neither his occupation
nor antecedents are surely known.

Samuel Fuller--the son of Edward Fuller and his wife--is called by
Bradford �a young child.�  He must have been some five or six years
of age, as he married in 1635, fifteen years later, and would
presumably have been of age, or nearly so.

Thomas Tinker�s name, the mention of his �wife� and �son,� the tradition
that they were �of the Leyden congregation� (which is not sure), the
certainty that they were MAY-FLOWER passengers,--on Brad ford�s
list,--and that all died early, are all we know of the Tinker
family.

John Turner and his two sons we know little about.  He seems to have been
a widower, as no mention is found of his wife, though this is not
certain.  He was of the Leyden congregation, and evidently a man of
some standing with the leaders, as he was made their messenger to
Carver and Cushman in London, in June, 1620, and was apparently
accustomed to travel. He appears to have had business of his own in
England at the time, and was apparently a man of sober age.  As he
had three children,--a daughter who came later to New England, and
two sons, as stated by Bradford,--it is probable that he was thirty
or over.  He and both his sons died in the spring of 1621.

Francis Eaton was of Leyden, a carpenter, and, having a wife and child,
was probably a young man about twenty five, perhaps a little
younger.  He married three times.
