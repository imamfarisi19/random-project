Mrs. Elizabeth Hopkins, nothing is known concerning, except that she was
not her husband�s first wife.  Sometime apparently elapsed between
her husband�s marriages.

Giles Hopkins we only know was the son of his father�s first wife, and
�about 15.�  An error (of the types presumably) makes Griffis (�The
Pilgrims in their Three Homes,� p. 176) give the name of Oceanus
Hopkins�s father as Giles, instead of Stephen.  Constance (or
Constantia) Hopkins was apparently about eleven years old in 1620,
as she married in 1627, and probably was then not far from eighteen
years old. Damaris Hopkins, the younger daughter of Master Hopkins,
was probably a very young child when she came in the MAY-FLOWER, but
her exact age has not been as certained.  Davis, as elsewhere noted,
makes the singular mistake of saying she was born after her parents
arrived in New England.  She married Jacob Cooke, and the
ante-nuptial agreement of his parents is believed to be the
earliest of record in America, except that between Gregory
Armstrong and the widow Billington.

Edward Dotey is called by Bradford �a servant,� but nothing is known of
his age or antecedents.  It is very certain from the fact that he
signed the Compact that he was twenty-one.  He was a very energetic
man. He seems to have been married before coming to New England, or
soon after.

Edward Leister (the name is variously spelled) was a �servant,� by
Bradford�s record.  He was doubtless of age, as he signed the
Compact.

Master John Crackstone, being (apparently) a widower with a son, a child
well grown, was evidently about thirty five years old when he
embarked for New England. He left a daughter behind.  He died early.

John Crackstone, Jr., was but a lad, and died early.

Master Edward Tilley (sometimes spelled Tillie) and his wife Ann seem to
have been without children of their own, and as they took with them
to New England two children who were their kindred, it may be
inferred that they had been married some little time. It is hence
probable that Mr. Tilley was in the neighborhood of thirty.  His
wife�s age is purely conjectural.  They were, Bradford states, �of
the Leyden congregation.�
