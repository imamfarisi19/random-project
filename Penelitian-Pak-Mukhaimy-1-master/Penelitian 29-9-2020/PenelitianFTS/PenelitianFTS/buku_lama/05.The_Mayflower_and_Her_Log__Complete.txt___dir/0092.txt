Goodwin, the brother of Mrs. Austin, quite at variance with his sister�s
conclusions, states, with every probability confirming him, that the
harbor Coppin sought �may have been Boston, Ipswich, Newburyport, or
Portsmouth.�

As a result of his �relation� as to a desirable harbor, Coppin was made
the �pilot� of the �third expedition,� which left the ship in the
shallop, Wednesday, December 6, and, after varying disasters and a narrow
escape from shipwreck--through Coppin�s mistake--landed Friday night
after dark, in the storm, on the island previously mentioned, ever since
called �Clarke�s Island,� at the mouth of Plymouth harbor.

Nothing further is known of Coppin except that he returned to England
with the ship.  He has passed into history only as Robert Coppin, �the
second mate� (or �pilot�) of the MAY-FLOWER.


But one other officer in merchant ships of the MAY-FLOWER class in her
day was dignified by the address of �Master� (or Mister), or had rank
with the Captain and Mates as a quarter-deck officer,--except in those
instances where a surgeon or a chaplain was carried.  That the MAY-FLOWER
carried no special ship�s-surgeon has been supposed from the fact of Dr.
Fuller�s attendance alike on her passengers and crew, and the increased
mortality of the seamen--after his removal on shore.

[The author is greatly indebted to his esteemed friend, Mr. George
Ernest Bowman, Secretary-General of the Society of MAY-FLOWER
Descendants, for information of much value upon this point. He
believes that he has discovered trustworthy evidence of the
existence of a small volume bearing upon its title-page an
inscription that would certainly indicate that the MAY-FLOWER had
her own surgeon. A copy of the inscription, which Mr. Bowman
declares well attested (the book not being within reach), reads as
follows:--
�To Giles Heale Chirurgeon,
from Isaac Allerton
in Virginia.
Feb. 10, 1620.�

Giles Heale�s name will be recognized as that of one of the
witnesses to John Carver�s copy of William Mullens�s nuncupative
will, and, if he was the ship�s-surgeon, might very naturally appear
in that relation.  If book and inscription exist and the latter is
genuine, it would be indubitable proof that Heale (who was surely
not a MAY-FLOWER passenger) was one of the ship�s company, and if a
�chirurgeon,� the surgeon of the ship, for no other Englishmen,
except those of the colonists and the ship�s company, could have
been at New Plymouth, at the date given, and New England was then
included in the term �Virginia.�  It is much to be hoped that Mr.
Bowman�s belief may be established, and that in Giles Heale we shall
have another known officer, the surgeon, of the MAY-FLOWER.]
