SATURDAY, Mar. 17/27
At anchor in harbor.  The Master and others
came off to the ship.  Samoset the Indian
went away back to the Massasoits whence he
came.  A reasonably fair day.  Fetched wood
and water.

SUNDAY, Mar. 18/28
At anchor in Plymouth harbor.  The
fourteenth Sunday the ship has lain at this
anchorage.  A fair day.  The sickness
stayed a little.  Many went on shore to the
meeting in the common-house.  Samoset the
savage came again, and brought five others
with him.

[This Sunday visit was doubtless very much to the dislike of the
good brethren, or at least of the leaders, but policy dictated every
possible forbearance.  Their consciences drew the line at trade,
however, and they got rid of their untimely visitors as soon as
possible without giving offense.  Massasoit�s men seem to have
shown, by leaving their peltry with them, a confidence in their new
white neighbors that is remarkable in view of the brevity of their
friendship.]

They left their bows and arrows a quarter
of a mile from the town, as instructed.
The Planters gave them entertainment, but
would not truck with them.

[�Truck--to trade.�  All early and modern lexicographers give the
word, which, though now obsolete, was in common use in parts of New
England fifty years ago.]

They sang and danced after their manner,
and made semblance of amity and friendship.
They drank tobacco and carried pounded corn
to eat.  Their faces were painted.  They
brought a few skins which they left with
the Planters, and returned the tools which
Captain Standish and Francis Cooke left in
the woods.  The Planters dismissed them
with a few trifles as soon as they could,
it being Sunday, and they promised soon to
return and trade.  Samoset would not go
with them, feigning sick, and stayed.
Those on shore from the ship came off to
her at night.

MONDAY, Mar. 19/29
At anchorage.  A fair day.  The Planters
digging and sowing seeds.

TUESDAY, Mar. 20/30
At anchorage.  A fine day.  Digging and
planting of gardens on shore.  Those sick
of the crew mending.
