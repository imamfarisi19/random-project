Degory Priest--or �Digerie,� as Bradford calls him--was a prominent
member of the Leyden body.  His marriage is recorded there, and he
left his family in the care of his pastor and friends, to follow him
later.  He died early.

Thomas Rogers and his son are reputed of the Leyden company.  He left
(according to Bradford) some of his family there--as did Cooke and
Priest--to follow later.  It has been suggested that Rogers might
have been of the Essex (England) lineage, but no evidence of this
appears.  The Rogers family of Essex were distinctively Puritans,
both in England and in the Massachusetts colony.

Moses Fletcher was a �smith� at Leyden, and of Robinson�s church.  He was
married there, in 1613, to his second wife.  He was perhaps of the
English Amsterdam family of Separatists, of that name.  As the only
blacksmith of the colonists, his early death was a great loss.

Thomas Williams, there seems no good reason to doubt, was the Thomas
Williams known to have been of Leyden congregation.  Hon. H. C.
Murphy and Arber include him--apparently through oversight alone
--in the list of those of Leyden who did not go, unless there were
two of the name, one of whom remained in Holland.

Thomas Tinker, wife, and son are not certainly known to have been of the
Leyden company, or to have embarked at Delfshaven, but their
constant association in close relation with others who were and who
so embarked warrants the inference that they were of the SPEEDWELL�S
passengers.  It is, however, remotely possible, that they were of
the English contingent.

Edward Fuller and his wife and little son were of the Leyden company, and
on the SPEEDWELL.  He is reputed to have been a brother of Dr.
Fuller, and is occasionally so claimed by early writers, but by what
warrant is not clear.

John Rigdale and his wife have always been placed by tradition and
association with the Leyden emigrants but there is a possibility
that they were of the English party.  Probability assigns them to
the SPEEDWELL, and they are needed to make her accredited number.
