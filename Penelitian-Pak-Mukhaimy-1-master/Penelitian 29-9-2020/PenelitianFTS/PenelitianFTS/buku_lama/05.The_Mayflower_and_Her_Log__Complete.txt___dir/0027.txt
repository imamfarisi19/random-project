Edward Tilley (sometimes given the prefix of Master) his wife Ann are
known to have been of the Leyden company.  (Bradford�s �Historie,�
p. 83.) It is doubtful if their �cousins,� Henry Sampson and
Humility Cooper, were of Leyden.  They apparently were English
kinsfolk, taken to New England with the Tilleys, very likely joined
them at Southampton and hence were not of the SPEEDWELL�S
passengers.  Humility Cooper returned to England after the death of
Tilley and his wife.  That Mrs. Tilley�s �given name� was Ann is not
positively established, but rests on Bradford�s evidence.

John Tilley (who is also sometimes called Master) is reputed a brother of
Edward, and is known to have been--as also his wife--of the Leyden
church (Bradford, Deane�s ed.  p. 83.) His second wife Bridget Van
der Velde, was evidently of Holland blood, and their marriage is
recorded in Leyden.  Elizabeth Tilley was clearly a daughter by an
earlier wife.  He is said by Goodwin (�Pilgrim Republic,� p. 32) to
have been a �silk worker� Leyden, but earlier authority for this
occupation is not found.

John Crackstone is of record as of the Leyden congregation.  His daughter
remained there, and came later to America.

John Crackstone, Jr., son of above.  Both were SPEEDWELL passengers.

Francis Cooke has been supposed a very early member of Robinson�s flock
in England, who escaped with them to Holland, in 1608.  He and his
son perhaps embarked at Delfshaven, leaving his wife and three other
children to follow later.  (See Robinson�s letter to Governor
Bradford, �Mass. Hist. Coll.,� vol. iii.  p. 45, also Appendix for
account of Cooke�s marriage.)

John Cooke, the son, was supposed to have lived to be the last male
survivor of the MAY-FLOWER, but Richard More proves to have survived
him. He was a prominent man in the colony, like his father, and the
founder of Dartmouth (Mass.).

John Turner and his sons are also known to have been of the Leyden party,
as he was undoubtedly the messenger sent to London with the letter
(of May 31) of the leaders to Carver and Cushman, arriving there
June 10, 1620.  They were beyond doubt of the SPEEDWELL�S list.
