Roger Wilder is also called a �man-servant� by Bradford, and hardly more
than this is known of him, his death occurring early.  There is no
clue to his age except that his being called a �man-servant� would
seem to suggest that he was of age; but the fact that he did not
sign the Compact would indicate that he was younger, or he may have
been extremely ill, as he died very soon after arrival.

William Latham is called a �boy� by Bradford, though a lad of 18.  It is
quite possible he was one of those �indentured� by the corporation
of London, but there is no direct intimation of this.

�Mrs. Carver�s maid,� it is fair to presume, from her position as
lady�s-maid and its requirements in those days, was a young woman of
eighteen or twenty years, and this is confirmed by her early
marriage.  Nothing is known of her before the embarkation.  She died
early.

Jasper More, Bradford says, �was a child yt was put to him.�  Further
information concerning him is given in connection with his brother
Richard, �indentured� to Elder Brewster.  He is erroneously called
by Justin Winsor in his �History of Duxbury� (Massachusetts) a child
of Carver�s, as Elizabeth Tilley is �his daughter.�  Others have
similarly erred.

Elder William Brewster�s known age at his death determines his age in
1620.  He was born in 1566-67.  His early life was full of interest
and activity, and his life in Holland and America no less so.  In
early life he filled important stations.  Steele�s �Chief of the
Pilgrims� is a most engaging biography of him, and there are others
hardly less so, Bradford�s sketch being one of the best.

Mrs. Mary Brewster�s age at her death determines it at the embarkation,
and is matter of computation.

Love Brewster was the second son of his parents, his elder brother
Jonathan coming over afterwards.

Wrestling Brewster was but a �lad,� and his father�s third son.

Richard More and his brother, Bradford states, �were put to him� (Elder
Brewster) as bound-boys.  For a full account of their English
origin, Richard�s affidavit, etc., see ante.  This makes him but
about six, but he was perhaps older.
