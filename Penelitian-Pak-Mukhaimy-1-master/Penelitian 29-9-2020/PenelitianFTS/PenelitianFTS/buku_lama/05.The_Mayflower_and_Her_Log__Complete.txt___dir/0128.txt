William Trevore was, according to Bradford, one of �two seamen hired to
stay a year in the countrie.�  He went back when his time expired,
but later returned to New England.  Cushman (Bradford, �Historie,�
p. 122) suggests that he was telling �sailors� yarns.�  He says:
�For William Trevore hath lavishly told but what he knew or imagined
of Capewock Martha�s Vineyard, Monhiggon, and ye Narragansetts.�  In
1629 he was at Massachusetts Bay in command of the HANDMAID
(Goodwin, p. 320), and in February, 1633 (Winthrop, vol. i. p. 100),
he seems to have been in command of the ship WILLIAM at Plymouth,
with passengers for Massachusetts Bay.  Captain Standish testified
in regard to Thompson�s Island in Boston harbor, that about 1620 he
�was on that Island with Trevore,� and called it �Island Trevore.�
(Bradford, �Historie,� Deane�s ed.  p. 209.)  He did not sign the
Compact, perhaps because of the limitations of his contract (one
year).

--- Ely (not Ellis, as Arber miscalls him, �The Story of the Pilgrim
Fathers,� p. 377) was the other of the �two seamen hired to stay a
year,� etc.  He also returned when his time expired.  (Bradford,
Hist. Mass. ed.  p. 534.) He did not sign the Compact, probably for
the reason operative in .Trevore�s case.  A digest of the foregoing
