The side lights upon the matter show, beyond doubt:--

(a) That a �pilott� had been sent to Holland, with Master Nash, before
May 31, 1620;

(b) That unless two had been sent (of which there is no suggestion, and
which is entirely improbable, for obvious reasons), Master Reynolds was
the �pilott� who was thus sent;

(c) That it is clear, from Cushman�s letter of June 11/21, that Reynolds
was then in Holland, for Cushman directs that �Master Reynolds tarrie
there and bring the ship to Southampton;�

(d) That Master Reynolds was not originally intended to �tarrie there,�
and �bring the ship,� etc., as, if he had been, there would have been no
need of giving such an order; and

(e) That he had been sent there for some other purpose than to bring the
SPEEDWELL to Southampton.  Duly considering all the facts together, there
can be no doubt that only one �pilott� was sent from England; that he was
expected to return when the work was done for which he went (apparently
the refitting of the SPEEDWELL); that he was ordered to remain for a new
duty, and that the man who performed that duty and brought the ship to
Southampton (who, we know was Master Reynolds) must have been the
�pilott�, sent over.

We are told too, by Bradford,

[Bradford�s Historie, as already cited; Arber, The Story of the
Pilgrim Fathers, p. 341.  John Brown, in his Pilgrim Fathers of New
England, p. 198, says: �She [the SPEEDWELL] was to remain with the
colony for a year.�  Evidently a mistake, arising from the length of
time for which her crew were shipped.  The pinnace herself was
intended, as we have seen, for the permanent use of they colonists,
and was to remain indefinitely.]

that the crew of the SPEEDWELL �were hired for a year,� and we know, in a
general way, that most of them went with her to London when she abandoned
the voyage.  This there is ample evidence Coppin did not do, going as he
did to New England as �second mate� or �pilott� of the MAY-FLOWER, which
there is no reason to doubt he was when she left London.  Neither is
there anywhere any suggestion that there was at Southampton any change in
the second mate of the larger ship, as there must have been to make good
the suggestion of Dr. Dexter.
