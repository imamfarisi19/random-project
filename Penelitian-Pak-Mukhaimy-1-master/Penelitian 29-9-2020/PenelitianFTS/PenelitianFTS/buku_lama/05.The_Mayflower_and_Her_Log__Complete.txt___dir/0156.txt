SATURDAY, July 29/Aug. 8
Lying at Quay, Southampton. Some of the
passengers transferred from SPEEDWELL and
some to her.  Master Christopher Martin
chosen by passengers their �Governour� for
the voyage to order them by the way, see to
the disposing of their pro visions, etc.
Master Robert Cushman chosen �Assistant.�
The ship ready for sea this day, but
obliged to lie here on account of leakiness
of consort, which is forced to retrim. Ship

MONDAY, July 31/Aug. 10
Lying at Southampton.  Letters received for
passengers from Holland.  One from the
Leyden Pastor [Robinson] read out to the
company that came from that place.

TUESDAY, Aug. 1/Aug. 11
Lying at anchor at Southampton.  SPEEDWELL
retrimmed a second time to overcome
leakiness.

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 2/Aug. 12
Lying at anchor at Southampton. Master
Weston, principal agent of the Merchants
setting out the voyage, came up from Lon
don to see the ships dispatched,  but, on
the refusal of the Planters to sign certain
papers, took offence and returned to London
in displeasure, bidding them �stand on
their own legs,� etc.

[The two �conditions� which Weston had changed in the proposed
agreement between the Adventurers and Planters, the Leyden leaders
refused to agree to.  Bradford, op  cit.  p. 61.  He says: �But they
refused to sign, and answered him that he knew right well that these
were not according to the first Agreement.�  Dr. Griffis has made
one of those little slips common to all writers--though perfectly
conversant with the facts--in stating as he does (The Pilgrims in
their Three Homes, etc.  p.  158), with reference to the new
�conditions� which some blamed Cushman for assenting to, as �more
fit for thieves and slaves than for honest men,� that, �nevertheless
they consented to them;� while on p. 169 he says �The SPEEDWELL
people [i.e.  the Leyden leaders would not agree with the new
conditions, without the consent of those left behind in Leyden.�
