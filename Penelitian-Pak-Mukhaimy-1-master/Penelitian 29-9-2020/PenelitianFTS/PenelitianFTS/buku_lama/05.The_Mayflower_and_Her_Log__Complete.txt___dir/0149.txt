Except for a few pieces of silver owned by the wealthiest of their
number, pewter was the most elegant and expensive of the Pilgrims�
table-ware.  A pewter platter said to have been �brought over in the
MAY-FLOWER� is now owned by the Pilgrim Society, which also exhibits
smaller pewter formerly Edward Winslow�s, and bearing his �arms,� for
which, as previously noted, a like claim is made.  Platters, dishes,
�potts,� ladles, bottles, �flaggons,� �skelletts,� cups, porringers,
�basons,� spoons, candlesticks, and salt �sellars,� were among the many
pewter utensils unmistakably brought on the good ship.

The wooden-ware of the colonists, brought with them, was considerable
and various.  The Dutch were long famous for its fabrication.  There was
but very little china, glass, or pottery of any kind in common use in
western Europe in 1620; some kinds were not yet made, and pewter, wood,
and leather largely filled their places.  Wooden trenchers (taking the
place of plates), trays, �noggins� (jug or pitcher-like cups), cups, and
�lossets� (flat dishes like the bread-plates of to day), were of course
part of every housewife�s providings.  Some few of Pilgrim origin
possibly still exist.  As neither coffee, tea, nor china had come into
use, the cups and saucers which another century brought in--to delight
their owners in that day and the ceramic hunter in this--were not
among the �breakables� of the �good-wife� of the MAY-FLOWER. The
�table-plenishings� had not much variety, but in the aggregate the
(first) �nineteen families� must have required quite a quantity of
spoons, knives, salt �sellars,� etc.  Forks there were none, and of the
accessories of to-day (except napkins), very few.  Meat was held by the
napkin while being cut with the knife.  Josselyn� gives a list of
�Implements for a family of six persons� going to New England.
