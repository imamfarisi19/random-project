Solomon Prower is clearly shown by the complaint made against him by the
Archdeacon of Chelmsford, the March before he sailed on the
MAY-FLOWER, to  have been quite a youth, a firm �Separatist,� and
something more than an ordinary �servant.�  He seems to have been
summoned before the Archdeacon at the same time with young Martin
(a son of Christopher), and this fact suggests some nearer relation
than that of �servant.�  He is sometimes spoken of as Martin�s
�son,� by what warrant does not appear, but the fact suggests that
he may have been a step-son.  Bradford, in recording his death,
says: �Dec. 24, this day dies Solomon Martin.�  This could, of
course, have been none other than Solomon Prower.  Dr. Young, in his
�Chronicles,� speaking of Martin, says, �he brought his wife and two
children.�  If this means Martin�s children, it is evidently an
error.  It may refer to age only.  His case is puzzling, for
Bradford makes him both �servant� and �son.�  If of sufficient age
and account to be cited before the Archdeacon for discipline, it
seems strange that he should not have signed the �Compact.�  Even if
a �servant� this would seem to have been no bar, as Dotey and
Leister were certainly such, yet signers. The indications are that
he was but a well-grown lad, and that his youth, or severe illness,
and not his station, accounts for the absence of his signature.  If
a young foster-son or kinsman of Martin, as seems most likely, then
Martin�s signature was sufficient, as in the cases of fathers for
their sons; if really a �ser vant� then too young (like Latham and
Hooke) to be called upon, as were Dotey and Leister.

John Langemore; there is nothing (save the errors of Dr. Young) to
indicate that he was other than a �servant.�

Richard Warren was probably from Kent or Essex.  Surprisingly little is
known of his antecedents, former occupation, etc.

William Mullens and his family were, as shown, from Dorking in Surrey,
and their home was therefore close to London, whence they sailed,
beyond doubt, in the MAY-FLOWER.  The discovery at Somerset House,
London, by Mr. Henry F. Waters, of Salem, Massachusetts; of what is
evidently the nuncupative will of William Mullens, proves an
important one in many particulars, only one of which need be
referred to in this connection, but all of which will receive due
consideration.  It conclusively shows Mr. Mullens not to have been
of the Leyden congregation, as has sometimes been claimed, but that
he was a well-to-do tradesman of Dorking in Surrey, adjacent to
London.  It renders it certain, too, that he had been some time
resident there, and had both a married daughter and a son (William),
doubtless living there, which effectually overthrows the �imaginary
history� of Baird, and of that pretty story, �Standish of Standish,�
whereby the Mullens (or Molines) family are given French (Huguenot)
antecedents and the daughter is endowed with numerous airs, graces,
and accomplishments, professedly French.
