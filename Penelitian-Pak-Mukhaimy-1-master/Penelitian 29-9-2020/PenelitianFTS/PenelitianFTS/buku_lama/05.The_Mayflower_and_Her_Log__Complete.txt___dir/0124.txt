Mrs. Sarah Eaton, wife of Francis, was evidently a young woman, with an
infant, at the date of embarkation.  Nothing more is known of her,
except that she died the spring following the arrival at Plymouth.

Samuel Eaton, the son of Francis and his wife, Sarah, Bradford calls �a
sucking child:� He lived to marry.

Gilbert Window was the third younger brother of Governor Edward Winslow,
and is reputed to have been a carpenter.  He was born on Wednesday,
October 26, 1600, at Droitwitch, in Worcester, England.  (�Winslow
Memorial,� vol. i.  p. 23.)  He apparently did not remain long in
the colony, as he does not appear in either the �land division� of
1623 or the �cattle division� of 1627; and hence was probably not
then in the �settlement,� though land was later allowed his heirs,
he having been an �original� voyager of the Plymouth colony.  He was
but twenty years and fifteen days old when he signed the Compact,
but probably was--from his brother�s prominence and his nearness to
his majority--counted as eligible. Bradford states that he returned
to England after �divers years� in New England, and died there. It
has been suggested that he went very early to some of the other
�plantations.�

John Alden was of Southampton, England, was hired as �a cooper,� was
twenty-one years old in 1620, as determined by the year of his
birth, 1599 (�Alden Memorial,� p. 1), and became the most prominent
and useful of any of the English contingent of the MAY FLOWER
company.  Longfellow�s delightful poem, �The Courtship of Miles
Standish,� has given him and his bride, Priscilla Mullens,
world-wide celebrity, though it is to be feared that its historical
accuracy would hardly stand criticism.  Why young Alden should have
been �hired for a cooper at Southampton,� with liberty to �go or
stay� in the colony, as Bradford says he was (clearly indicating
that he went to perform some specific work and return, if he liked,
with the ship), has mystified many.  The matter is clear, however,
when it is known, as Griffis shows, that part of a Parliamentary Act
of 1543 reads: �Whosoever shall carry Beer beyond Sea, shall find
Sureties to the Customers (?) of that Port, to bring in Clapboard
[staves] meet [sufficient] to make so much Vessel [barrel or
�kilderkin�] as he shall carry forth.�  As a considerable quantity of
beer was part of the MAY-FLOWER�S lading, and her consignors stood
bound to make good in quantity the stave-stock she carried away,
it was essential, in going to a wild country where it could not be
bought, but must be �got out� from the growing timber, to take along
a �cooper and cleaver� for that purpose.  Moreover, the great demand
for beer-barrel stock made �clapboard� good and profitable return
lading.  It constituted a large part of the FORTUNE�S return freight
(doubtless �gotten out� by Alden), as it would have undoubtedly of
the MAY-FLOWER�S, had the hardship of the colony�s condition
permitted.
