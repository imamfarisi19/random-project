Henry Sampson was apparently but a young English lad when he came over in
the MAY-FLOWER with his cousins the Tilleys.  As he married in 1636,
he was probably then about twenty-one, which would make him five or
six when he came over.  Goodwin (�Pilgrim Republic,� p. 184) says he
was �six.�

Humility Cooper is said by Bradford to have been a �cosen� of the
Tilleys, but no light is given as to her age or antecedents.  She
was but a child, apparently.  She returned to England very soon
after the death of Mr. and Mrs. Tilley, and �died young.�

Master John Tilley, having twice married, and having a daughter some
fourteen years old, must have been over thirty-five years old when
he sailed on the Pilgrim ship.  His birthplace and antecedents are
not known, but he was �of the Leyden congregation.�

Mrs. Bridget (Van der Velde) Tilley was just possibly a second wife.
Nothing is known concerning her except that she was of Holland, and
that she had, apparently, no child.

Elizabeth Tilley is said by Goodwin (op. cit.  p. 298) and others to have
been fourteen years old at her parents� death in 1621, soon after
the arrival in New England.  She was the child of her father�s first
wife.  She married John Howland before 1624.  Historians for many
years called her the �daughter of Governor Carver,� but the recovery
of Bradford�s MS. �historie� corrected this, with many other
misconceptions, though to some the error had become apparent before.
Her will also suggests her age.

Francis Cooke�s age in 1620 is fixed by his known age at his death
(�about 81�) in 1663.  He was from the north of England, and long a
member of Robinson�s congregation, both in England and in
Holland(?).

John Cooke, son of Francis, is known to have been about ten years old
when he sailed with his father for America, as his parents did not
marry before 1609.  He was undoubtedly born at Leyden.  He was long
supposed to have been the last male survivor of the original
passengers (dying at Dartmouth in 1695.)
