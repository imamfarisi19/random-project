It seems certain that by the expression, �we have hired another pilot
here, one Master Clarke,� etc.; that Cushman was reckoning the �pilott�
Reynolds whom he had hired and sent over to them in Holland, as shown--as
at the first, and now Clarke as �another.�  It nowhere appears that up to
this date, any other than these two had been hired, nor had there been
until then, any occasion for more than one.

If Cushman had been engaged in such important negotiations as these
before he wrote his letters to Carver and the Leyden friends, on Saturday
morning, he would certainly have mentioned them.  As he named neither, it
is clear that they had not then occurred.  It is equally certain that
Cushman�s appeal to Weston was not made, and his renewed activity
aroused, until after these letters had been dispatched and nothing of the
kind could have been done without Weston.

His letter-writing of June 10 was obviously in the morning, as proven by
the great day�s work Cushman performed subsequently.  He must have
written his letters early and have taken them to such place as his
messenger had suggested (Who his messenger was does not appear, but it
was not John Turner, as suggested by Arber, for he did not arrive till
that night.) Cushman must then have looked up Weston and had an hour or
more of earnest argument with him, for he says: �at the last [as if some
time was occupied] he gathered himself up a little more� [i.e.  yielded
somewhat.]  Then came an interval of �two hours,� at the end of which
Weston came to him,

[It would be highly interesting to know whether, in the two hours
which intervened between Cushman�s call on Weston and the latter�s
return call, Weston consulted Gorges and got his instructions.  It
is certain that he came prepared to act, and that vigorously, which
he had not previously been.]

and they �advised together,�--which took time.  It was by this evidently
somewhat past noon, a four or five hours having been consumed.  They then
went to look for a ship and found one, which, from Cushman�s remark, �but
a fine ship it is,� they must (at least superficially) have examined.
While hunting for the ship they seem to have come across, and to have
hired, John Clarke the �pilot,� with whom they necessarily, as with the
ship�s people, spent some time.  It is not improbable that the approach
of dusk cut short their examination of the ship, which they hence �took
liking of [refusal of] till Monday.�  It is therefore evident that the
�refusal� of the �sixty last� ship was taken, and the �pilot� Clarke was
�hired,� on Saturday afternoon, June 10, as on Sunday, June 11, Cushman
informed the Leyden leaders of these facts by letter, as above indicated,
and gave instructions as to the SPEEDWELL�S �pilott,� Master Reynolds.
