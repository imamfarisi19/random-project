WEDNESDAY, Aug. 16/26
Lying at anchor, Dartmouth harbor.
SPEEDWELL being thoroughly overhauled for
leaks.  Pronounced �as open and leaky as a
sieve.�  Much dissatisfaction between the
passengers, and discontent with the ship�s
�governour� Master Martin, between whom
and Mr. Cushman, the �assistant,� there is
constant disagreement.

[Cushman portrays the contemptible character and manner of Martin
very sharply, and could not have wished to punish him worse for his
meannesses than he has, by thus holding him up to the scorn of the
world, for all time.  He says, �inter alia�: �If I speak to him, he
flies in my face and saith no complaints shall be heard or received
but by himself, and saith: �They are froward, and waspish,
discontented people, and I do ill to hear them.��]

THURSDAY, Aug. 17/27
Lying at anchor, Dartmouth harbor.  Consort
being searched and mended. Sailors offended
at Master Martin because of meddling.

[Cushman�s letter, Dartmouth, August 17.  He says: �The sailors also
are so offended at his ignorant boldness in meddling and controling
in things he knows not what belongs to, as that some threaten to
mischief him .  .  .  .  But at best this cometh of it, that he
makes himself a scorn and laughing stock unto them.�]

[Bradford, Historie, Deane�s ed.  p. 68.  He says: �Some leaks were
found and mended and now it was conceived by the workmen and all,
that she was sufficient, and they might proceed without either fear
or danger.�  Bradford shows (op. cit.  p. 69) note that they must
have left Dartmouth �about the 21st� of August.  Captain John Smith
gives that date, though somewhat confusedly.  Arber (the Story of
the Pilgrim Fathers, p. 343 says: �They actually left on 23 August.�
Goodwin (Pilgrim Republic, p. 55) says : �Ten days were spent in
discharging and re-stowing the SPEEDWELL and repairing her from stem
to stern,� etc.)]
