WEDNESDAY, Dec. 20/30
At anchor, Plymouth harbor, many ill. Dec.
After service the colonists decided to go
ashore this morning and determine upon one
of two places which were thought most
fitting for their habitation.  So a
considerable party went ashore and left
twenty of their number there to make a
rendezvous, the rest coming on board at
night.  They reported that they had chosen
by the most voices the site first looked at
by the largest brook, near where they
landed on the 11th on a large rock
[Plymouth Rock].

[The �Rock� seems to have become the established landing place of
the Pilgrims, from the time of the first visit of the third
exploring party on December 11/21.  The absurdity of the claims of
the partisans of Mary Chilton, in the foolish contention which
existed for many years as to whether she or John Alden was the first
person to set foot upon the �Rock,� is shown by the fact that, of
course, no women were with the third exploring party which first
landed there, while it is also certain that Alden was not of that
exploring party.  That Mary Chilton may have been the first woman to
land at Cape Cod harbor is entirely possible, as it is that she or
John Alden may have been the first person to land on the �Rock�
after the ship arrived in Plymouth harbor.  It was a vexatious
travesty upon history (though perpetuated by parties who ought to
have been correct) that the Association for building the Pilgrim
Monument at Plymouth should issue a pamphlet giving a picture of the
�Landing of the Pilgrims, December 21, 1620,� in which women are
pictured, and in which the shallop is shown with a large
fore-and-aft mainsail, while on the same page is another picture
entitled, �The Shallop of the MAY-FLOWER,� having a large yard and
square-sail, and a �Cuddy� (which last the MAY-FLOWER�S shallop we
know did not have).  The printed description of the picture,
however, says: �The cut is copied from a picture by Van der Veldt,
a Dutch painter of the seventeenth century, representing a
shallop,� etc.  It is matter of regret to find that a book like
Colonel T. W. Higginson�s �Book of American Explorers�, intended
for a text-book, and bearing the imprint of a house like Longmans,
Green & Co. should actually print a �cut� showing Mary Chilton
landing from a boat full of men (in which she is the only woman)
upon a rock, presumably Plymouth Rock.]
