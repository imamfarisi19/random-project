WEDNESDAY, April 4/14
Still at anchor in Plymouth harbor.  Sails
loosened and all ready for departure except
Governor�s letters.  Last visits of shore
people to ship.  Sail with morning tide, if
wind serves.  One hundred and ten days in
this harbor.

THURSDAY, April 5/15
Got anchors, and with fair wind got
underway at full tide.  Many to bid adieu.
Set colors and gave Planters a parting
salute with the ensign and ordnance.
Cleared the harbor without hindrance, and
laid general course E.S.E.  for England
with a fine wind.  Took departure from Cape
Cod early in the day, shook off the land
and got ship to rights before night.  All
sails set and the ship logging her best.



And so the MAY-FLOWER began her speedy, uneventful, homeward run,
of but thirty-one days, arriving in England May 6, 1621, having been
absent, on her �round voyage,� from her sailing port, two hundred and
ninety-six days.



THE END OF THE VOYAGE
AND OF THIS
JOURNAL



AUTHOR�S NOTE.  Of the �Log� Of the MAY-FLOWER, the author is able to
repeat the assurance given as to the brief Journal of the SPEEDWELL, and
is able to say, in the happy phrase of Griffis, �I have tried to state
only recorded facts, or to give expression to well grounded inferences.�
