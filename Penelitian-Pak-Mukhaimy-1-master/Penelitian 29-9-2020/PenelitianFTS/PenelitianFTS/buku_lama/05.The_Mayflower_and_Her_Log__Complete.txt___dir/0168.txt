to regulate their civil government.  This
done, they confirmed Master Carver their
�governour� in the ship on the voyage,
their �governour� for the year.  Bore up
for the Cape, and by short tacks made the
Cape [Paomet, now Provincetown] Harbor,
coming to an anchorage a furlong within the
point.  The bay so circular that before
coming to anchor the ship boxed the compass
[i.e.  went clear around all points of it].

Let go anchors three quarters of an English
mile off shore, because of shallow water,
sixty-seven days from Plymouth (Eng.),
eighty-one days from Dartmouth, ninety-nine
days from Southampton, and one hundred and
twenty from London.  Got out the long-boat
and set ashore an armed party of fifteen or
sixteen in armor, and some to fetch wood,
having none left, landing them on the long
point or neck, toward the sea.

[The strip of land now known as Long Point, Provincetown (Mass.)
harbor.]
Those going ashore were forced to wade a
bow-shot or two in going aland.  The party
sent ashore returned at night having seen
no person or habitation, having laded the
boat with juniper wood.

SUNDAY, Nov. 12/22
At anchor in Cape Cod harbor.  All hands
piped to service.  Weather mild.

MONDAY, Nov. 13/23
At anchor in Cape Cod harbor, unshipped the
shallop and drew her on land to mend and
repair her.

[Bradford (Historie, Mass. ed. p. 97) says: �Having brought a large
shallop with them out of England, stowed in quarters in ye ship they
now gott her out and sett their carpenters to worke to trime her up:
but being much brused and shatered in ye ship with foule weather,
they saw she sould be longe in mending.�  In �Mourt�s Relation� he
says: �Monday, the 13th of November, we unshipped our shallop and
drew her on land to mend and repair her, having been forced to cut
her down, in bestowing her betwixt the decks, and she was much
opened, with the peoples lying in her, which kept us long there: for
it was sixteen or seventeen days before the Carpenter had finished
her.�  Goodwin says she was �a sloop-rigged craft of twelve or
fifteen tons.�  There is an intimation of Bradford that she was
�about thirty feet long.�  It is evident from Bradford�s account
(Historie, Mass. ed. p. 105) of her stormy entrance to Plymouth
harbor that the shallop had but one mast, as he says �But herewith
they broake their mast in 3 pieces and their saill fell overboard in
a very grown sea.�]
