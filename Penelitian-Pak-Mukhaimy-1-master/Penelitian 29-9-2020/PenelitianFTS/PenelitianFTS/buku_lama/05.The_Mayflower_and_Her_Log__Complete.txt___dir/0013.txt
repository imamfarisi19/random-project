It is evident, however, from John Robinson�s letter of June 14, 1620, to
John Carver, that Weston ridiculed the transaction, probably on selfish
grounds, but, as events proved, not without some justification.

Robinson says: �Master Weston makes himself merry with our endeavors
about buying a ship,� [the SPEEDWELL] �but we have done nothing in this
but with good reason, as I am persuaded.�  Although bought with funds
raised in Holland,

[Arber (The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers, p. 341) arrives at the
conclusion that �The SPEEDWELL had been bought with Leyden money.
The proceeds of her sale, after her return to London, would, of
course, go to the credit of the common joint-Stock there.�  This
inference seems warranted by Robinson�s letter of June 16/26 to
Carver, in which he clearly indicates that the Leyden brethren
collected the �Adventurers� subscriptions of Pickering and his
partner (Greene), which were evidently considerable.]

it was evidently upon �joint-account,� and she was doubtless so sold, as
alleged, on her arrival in September, at London, having proved
unseaworthy.  In fact, the only view of this transaction that harmonizes
with the known facts and the respective rights and relations of the
parties is, that permission was obtained (perhaps through Edward
Pickering, one of the Adventurers, a merchant of Leyden, and others) that
the Leyden leaders should buy and refit the consort, and in so doing
might expend the funds which certain of the Leyden Pilgrims were to pay
into the enterprise, which it appears they did,--and for which they would
receive, as shown, extra shares in the Planters� half-interest.  It was
very possibly further permitted by the Adventurers, that Mr. Pickering�s
and his partners� subscriptions to their capital stock should be applied
to the purchase of the SPEEDWELL, as they were collected by the Leyden
leaders, as Pastor Robinson�s  letter of June 14/24 to John Carver,
previously noted, clearly shows.
