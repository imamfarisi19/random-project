While it was feasible, when lying quietly at anchor in a land-locked
harbor, with abundance of fire-wood at hand, to have a fire, about which
they could gather, even if only upon the �sand-hearth� of the early
navigators, when upon boisterous seas, in mid-ocean, �lying .  .  .  in
their cabins� was the only means of keeping warm possible to voyagers.
In �Good Newes from New England,� we find the lines:--

�Close cabins being now prepared,
With bred, bief, beire, and fish,
The passengers prepare themselves,
That they might have their wish.�

Her magazine, carpenter�s and sailmaker�s lockers, etc., were doubtless
well forward under her forecastle, easily accessible from the spar-deck,
as was common to merchant vessels of her class and size.  Dr. Young, in
his �Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers� (p. 86, note), says: �This vessel
was less than the average size of the fishing-smacks that go to the Grand
Banks.  This seems a frail bark in which to cross a stormy ocean of three
thousand miles in extent.  Yet it should be remembered that two of the
ships of Columbus on his first daring and perilous voyage of discovery,
were light vessels, without decks, little superior to the small craft
that ply on our rivers and along our coasts .  .  .  .  Frobisher�s fleet
consisted of two barks of twenty-five tons each and a pinnace of ten
tons, when he sailed in 1576 to discover a north-west passage to the
Indies.  Sir Francis Drake, too, embarked on his voyage for
circumnavigating the globe, in 1577, with five vessels, of which the
largest was of one hundred, and the smallest fifteen tons.  The bark in
which Sir Humphrey Gilbert perished was of ten tons only.�  The LITTLE
JAMES, which the Company sent to Plymouth in July, 1623, was �a pinnace
of only forty-four tons,� and in a vessel of fifty tons (the SPEEDWELL),
Martin Pring, in 1603, coasted along the shores of New England.  Goodwin
says: �In 1587 there were not in all England�s fleet more than five
merchant vessels exceeding two hundred tons.�  The SPARROW-HAWK wrecked
on Cape Cod in 1626 was only 40 feet �over all.�  The Dutch seem to have
built larger vessels.  Winthrop records that as they came down the
Channel, on their way to New England (1630), they passed the wreck of
�a great Dutch merchantman of a thousand tons.�
