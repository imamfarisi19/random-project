Little work possible.  The little house for
the sick people on shore took fire this
afternoon, by a spark that kindled in the
roof.  No great harm done.  The Master
going ashore, killed five geese, which he
distributed among the sick people.  He also
found a good deer the savages had killed,
having also cut off his horns.  A wolf was
eating him.  Cannot conceive how he came
there.

FRIDAY, Feb. 16/26
At anchorage.  Northerly wind continues,
which continues the frost.  Those from
shore reported that one of the Planters,
being out fowling and hidden in the reeds,
about a mile and a half from the
settlement, saw twelve Indians marching
toward the plantation and heard many more.
He hurried home with all speed and gave the
alarm, so all the people in the woods at
work returned and armed themselves, but saw
nothing of the Indians.  Captain Standish�s
and Francis Cooke�s tools also stolen by
Indians in woods.  A great fire toward
night seen from the ship, about where the
Indians were discovered.
