[Vessels leaving the port of London always, in that day, �dropped
down with the tide,� tug-boats being unknown, and sail-headway
against the tide being difficult in the narrow river.]

Masters Cushman and Martin, agents of the
chartering--party, came aboard at London.

SUNDAY, July 16/26

In Channel.  Southampton Water.

WEDNESDAY, July 19/29
Southampton Water.  Arrived at Southampton
and came to anchor.

[Both ships undoubtedly lay at anchor a day or two, before hauling
in to the quay.  The MAY-FLOWER undoubtedly lay at anchor until
after the SPEEDWELL arrived, to save expense]

THURSDAY, July 20/30
Lying at Southampton off north end of �West
Quay.�

FRIDAY, July 21/31

Delfshaven, July 22, consort to this ship,
arrived in harbor, having on board some 70
passengers and lading for Virginia.  She
came to anchor off north end �West Quay.�

THURSDAY, July 27/Aug. 6
Lying at Quay, Southampton, SPEEDWELL
warped to berth at Quay near the ship, to
transfer lading.

[Some of the cargo of the SPEEDWELL is understood to have been here
transferred to the larger ship; doubtless the cheese, �Hollands,�
and other provisions, ordered, as noted, by Cushman]

FRIDAY, July 28/Aug. 7
Lying at Quay, Southampton, Much parleying
and discontent among the passengers.

[Bradford gives an account of the bickering and recrimination at
Southampton, when all parties had arrived.  Pastor Robinson had
rather too strenuously given instructions, which it now began to be
seen were not altogether wise.  Cushman was very much censured, and
there was evidently some acrimony.  See Cushman�s Dartmouth letter
of August 17 to Edward Southworth, Bradford�s Historie, Mass. ed.
p. 86.]
