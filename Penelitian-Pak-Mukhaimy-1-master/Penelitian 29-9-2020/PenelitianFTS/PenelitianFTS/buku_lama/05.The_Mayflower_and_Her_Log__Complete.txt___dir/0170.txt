Another exploration getting ready for

and return for England.  Fetched wood and
water.

SUNDAY, Nov. 26/Dec. 6
At anchor, Cape Cod harbor.  Third Sunday
here.  Master notified Planters that they
must find permanent location and that he
must and would keep sufficient supplies for
ship�s company and their return.

[Bradford, Historie, Mass.  ed. p. 96.  The doubt as to how the
ship�s and the colonists� provisions were divided and held is again
suggested here.  It is difficult, however, to understand how the
Master �must and would� retain provisions with his small force
against the larger, if it came to an issue of strength between Jones
and Standish.]

MONDAY, Nov. 27/Dec. 7
At anchor, Cape Cod harbor.  Rough weather
and cross winds.  The Planters determined
to send out a strong exploring party, and
invited the Master of the ship to join them
and go as leader, which he agreed continued
to, and offered nine of the crew and the
long-boat, which were accepted.  Of the
colonists there were four-and-twenty,
making the party in all four-and-thirty.
Wind so strong that setting out from the
ship the shallop and long-boat were obliged
to row to the nearest shore and the men to
wade above the knees to land.  The wind
proved so strong that the shallop was
obliged to harbor where she landed.  Mate
in charge of ship.  Blowed and snowed all
day and at night, and froze withal.
Mistress White delivered of a son which is
called �Peregrine.�  The second child born
on the voyage, the first in this harbor.
