Hudson.  Was not active, and appears as a signer only.

Keayne.  Was a well-to-do citizen of the vicinity of London, a friend, in
a general way, of the Pilgrims.  He came to Boston with Winthrop.
Was prominent in the Massachusetts Colony.  Was the founder and
first commander of the early Artillery Company of Boston, the oldest
military organization of the United States, and died at Boston,
leaving a large estate and a very remarkable will, of which he made
Governor Winslow an �overseer.�  He was an erratic,--but valuable,
citizen.

Knight (Eliza).  Seems to have been the only woman of the Adventurers, so
far as they are known, but no thing is known of her.  It has been
suggested that the given name has been wrongly spelled and should be
�Eleazar,�--a man�s name,--but the �Composition� gives the signature
as Eliza, clearly, as published.

Knight (John).  Finds no especial mention.  He was probably a relative of
Eliza.

Knowles.  Appears only as a signer of the �Composition.�

Ling.  Was a wealthy friend of the colonists and always true to them.  He
lost his property and was in poverty when the Pilgrims (though not
yet well on their feet), in grateful remembrance of his fidelity,
sent him a generous gift.

Martin.  Was the first treasurer of the colonists and also a MAY-FLOWER
Pilgrim.  Mention of him appears later. He was no credit to the
Company, and his early death probably prevented much vexation.

Millsop.  Appears only as a signer of the �Composition.�

Mott.  Has no especial mention, but is believed to have sent some of his
people to Plymouth Colony at an early day.

Mullens.  Was, as appears elsewhere, a well-conditioned tradesman of
Surrey, England, who was both an Adventurer and a MAY-FLOWER
Pilgrim, and Martin and himself appear to have been the only ones
who enjoyed that distinction.  He died, however, soon after the
arrival at Plymouth.  That he was an Adventurer is but recently
discovered by the author, but there appears no room for doubt as to
the fact. His record was brief, but satisfactory, in its relation to
the Pilgrims.
