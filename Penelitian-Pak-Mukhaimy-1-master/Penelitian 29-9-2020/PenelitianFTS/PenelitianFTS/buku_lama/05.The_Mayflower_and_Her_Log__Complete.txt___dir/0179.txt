FRIDAY, Jan. 12/Jan. 22
At anchor in harbor.  Began to rain at noon
and stopped all work.  Those coming aboard
ship at night reported John Goodman and
Peter Browne, two of the colonists,
missing, and fears entertained that they
may have been taken by Indians.  Froze and
snowed at night.  The first snow for a
month. An extremely cold night.

SATURDAY, Jan. 13/Jan. 23
At anchor in harbor.  The Governor sent out
an armed party of ten or twelve to look for
the missing men, but they returned without
seeing or hearing anything at all of them.
Those on shipboard much grieved, as deeming
them lost.  Fetched wood and water.

SUNDAY, Jan. 14/Jan. 24
At anchor in harbor.  About six o�clock in
the morning, the wind being very great, the
watch on deck spied the great new
rendezvous on shore on fire and feared it
fired by Indians, but the tide being out,
men could not get ashore for three quarters
of an hour, when they went armed.  At the
landing they heard that the lost men were
returned, some frost-bitten, and that the
thatch of the common-house only was burnt
by a spark, but no other harm done the
roof.  The most loss was Governor Carver�s
and Master Bradford�s, both of whom lay
sick in bed, and narrowly missed being
blown up with powder.  The meeting was to
have been kept ashore to-day, the greater
number of the people now being there, but
the fire, etc., prevented.  Some of those
sick in the common-house were fain to
return aboard for shelter.  Fifth Sunday in
this harbor.

MONDAY, Jan. 15/Jan. 25
At anchor in Plymouth harbor.  Rained much
all day.  They on shipboard could not go
ashore nor they on shore do any labor, but
were all wet.

TUESDAY, Jan. 16/Jan. 26
At anchorage.  A fine, sunshining day like
April.  Party went aland betimes.  Many ill
both on ship and on shore.

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 17/Jan. 27
At anchorage.  Another fine, sunshining
day.  Working-party went aland early. Set
on shore some of the Planters� goods.
