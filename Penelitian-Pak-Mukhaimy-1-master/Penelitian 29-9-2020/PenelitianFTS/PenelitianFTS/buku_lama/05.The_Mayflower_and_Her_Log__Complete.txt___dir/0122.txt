James Chilton�s antecedents and his age are quite unknown. He must have
been at least fifty, as he had a married daughter in Leyden,
according to Bradford.  He died among the first, and there is
nothing of record to inform us concerning him, except Bradford�s
meagre mention.  He may have lived at Leyden.

Mrs. Chilton�s given name is declared by one writer to have been Susanna,
but it is not clearly proven.  Whence she came, her ancestry, and
her age, are alike unknown.

Mary Chilton was but a young girl in 1620.  She married, before 1627,
John Winslow, and was probably not then over twenty, nor over
fourteen when she came with her parents in the MAY-FLOWER.

Thomas Rogers appears, from the fact that he had a son, a lad well-grown,
to have been thirty or more in 1620.  His birthplace, antecedents,
and history are unknown, but he appears to have been �of the Leyden
congregation.�  His wife and children came later.

Joseph Rogers was only a �lad� aboard the MAY-FLOWER, but he left a
considerable posterity.  Nothing is surely known of him, except that
he was Thomas�s son.

Degory Priest had the distinction of being �freeman� of Leyden, having
been admitted such, November 16, 1615.  He was by occupation a
�hatter,� a man of some means, who left a wife and at least two
children in Holland when he embarked for America.  His known age at
death gives his age at sailing but a few months previous.  At his
marriage in Leyden, October 4, 1611, he was called �of London.�  He
was about thirty-two when he married.  His wife (a widow Vincent)
was a sister of Isaac Allerton, who also was married at the same
time that he was. Goodwin (�Pilgrim Republic,� p. 183) also gives
his age as �forty-one.�  His widow remarried and came over later.
Dexter (�Mourt�s Relation,� p. 69, note) states, quoting from Leyden
MS. records, that �Degory Priest in April, 1619, calling himself a
�hatter,� deposes that he �is forty years of age.��  He must,
therefore, have been about forty-one when he sailed on the
MAY-FLOWER, and forty-two years old at his death.
