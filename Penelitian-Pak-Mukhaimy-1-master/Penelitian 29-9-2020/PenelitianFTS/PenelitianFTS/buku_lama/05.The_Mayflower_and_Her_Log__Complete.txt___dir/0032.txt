�When they came to the place� [Delfshaven], says Bradford, �they found
the ship and all things ready; and such of their friends as could not
come with them [from Leyden] followed after them; and sundry also came
from Amsterdam (about fifty miles) to see them shipped, and to take their
leave of them.�

Saturday, July 22/Aug. 1, 1620, the Pilgrim company took their farewells,
and Winslow records: �We only going aboard, the ship lying to the key
[quay] and ready to sail; the wind being fair, we gave them [their
friends] a volley of small shot [musketry] and three pieces of ordnance
and so lifting up our hands to each other and our hearts for each other
to the Lord our God, we departed.�

Goodwin says of the parting: �The hull was wrapped in smoke, through
which was seen at the stern the white flag of England doubly bisected by
the great red cross of St. George, a token that the emigrants had at last
resumed their dearly-loved nationality.  Far above them at the main was
seen the Union Jack of new device.�


And so after more than eleven years of banishment for conscience� sake
from their native shores, this little band of English exiles, as true to
their mother-land--despite persecutions--as to their God, raised the
flag of England, above their own little vessel, and under its folds set
sail to plant themselves for a larger life in a New World.

And thus opens the �Log� of the SPEEDWELL, and the �Westward-Ho� of the
Pilgrim Fathers.
