Browning.  Does not appear to have been active, and little is known of
him.

Collier.  Was a stanch and steadfast friend.  Finally cast in his lot
with the Pilgrims at New Plymouth and became a leading man in the
government there.  His life is well known.  He was a �brewer.�

Coventry.  Appears only as a signer, and nothing is known of him.

Fletcher.  Was a well-to-do merchant of London, a warm friend and a
reliance of the Pilgrims.  The loss of the LITTLE JAMES was a severe
blow to him financially.

Greene.  Appears to have been a merchant and a partner in Holland (and
perhaps at London) of Edward Pickering.  They were well acquainted
personally with the Pilgrims, and should have been among their most
liberal and surest friends.  Facts indicate, however, that they were
sordid in their interest and not entirely just.

Goffe.  Was a London merchant and ship-owner, as else where appears.
He was not only a Merchant Adventurer, but a patentee and
deputy-governor of the Massachusetts Company, and an intimate
friend of Winthrop.  He lost heavily by his New England ventures.
There is, as shown elsewhere, good reason to believe that he was
the owner of the MAY-FLOWER on her historic voyage, as also when
she came over in Higginson�s and Winthrop�s fleets, ten years
later.

Gudburn.  Appears only as a signer, so far as known.

Hatherly.  Was a well-to-do friend of the Pilgrims, and after many
complaints had been made against them among the �Purchasers�
--arising out of the rascality of Shirley and Allerton--went to New
England on a mission of inquiry.  He was perfectly convinced of the
Pilgrims� integrity and charmed with the country.  He made another
visit, and removed thither in 1633, to remain.  He became at once
prominent in the government of New Plimoth Colony.

Heath.  Does not appear to have been active, and naught is known of him.

Hobson.  Is known only as a signer of the �Composition.�

Holland.  Was a friend and ally of the Pilgrims, and one of their
correspondents.  He is supposed to have been of the ancient house of
that name and to have lived in London.
