It is impossible, in the space at command, to give more than briefest
mention of each of these individual Adventurers.

Allden.  Was at one time unfriendly to the Pilgrims,--Bradford calls him
�one of our powerfullest opposers,�--but later their ally.  Little
is known of him. He appears to have been of London.

Altham.  Was Master of the pinnace LITTLE JAMES, belonging chiefly to
Fletcher, and apparently expected to command her on her voyage to
New Plymouth in 1623, as consort of the ANNE, but for some reason
did not go, and William Bridge went as her Master, in his stead.

Andrews (Richard).  Was one of the wealthiest and most liberal of the
Adventurers.  He was a haberdasher of Cheapside, London, and an
Alderman of the city. He became an early proprietor and liberal
benefactor of the Massachusetts Bay Company, but most illogically
gave the debt due him from Plymouth Colony (L540) to the stronger
and richer Bay Colony.  He had been, however, unjustly prejudiced
against the Pilgrims, probably through the deceit of Pierce, Weston,
Shirley, and Allerton.

Andrews (Thomas).  A Lord Mayor of London, reputed a brother of the
last-named.  Never very active in the Adventurers� affairs, but
friendly, so far as appears.

Anthony.  Little or nothing is known concerning him.

Bass.  Was one of the enduring friends of the struggling Colony and
loaned them money when they were in dire straits and the prospect of
recovery was not good.  He was of London, and considerable is known
concerning him.

Beauchamp.  Was one of the most active of the Company for many years.
Generally to be relied upon as the Colony�s friend, but not without
some sordid self seeking.  Apparently a wealthy citizen and �salter�
of London.

Brewer.  Is too well-known as long the partner of Brewster in the conduct
of the �hidden press� at Leyden, and as a sufferer for conscience�
sake, to require identification.  He was a wealthy man, a scholar,
writer, printer, and publisher.  Was of the University of Leyden,
but removed to London after the departure of the chief of the
Pilgrims.  Was their stanch friend, a loyal defender of the faith,
and spent most of his later life in prison, under persecution of the
Bishops.
