The fact that Lyford (Bradford, Historie, Mass. ed. p. 217)
recommended that every �particular� (i.e.  non-partnership colonist)
sent out by the Adventurers--and they had come to be mostly of that
class--�should come over as an Adventurer, even if only a ser vant,�
and the fact that he recognized that some one would have to pay in
L10 to make each one an Adventurer, would seem to indicate that any
one was eligible and that either L10 was the price of the Merchant
Adventurer�s share, or that this was the smallest subscription which
would admit to membership.  Such �particular,� even although an
Adventurer, had no partnership share in the Planters� half-interest;
had no voice in the government, and no claim for maintenance.  He
was, however, amenable to the government, subject to military duty
and to tax.  The advantage of being an Adventurer without a voice in
colony affairs would be purely a moral one.]

that every person joining the enterprise, whether man, woman, youth,
maid, or servant, if sixteen years old, should count as a share; that a
share should be reckoned at L10, and hence that L10 worth of money or
provisions should also count as a share.  Every man, therefore, would be
entitled to one share for each person (if sixteen years of age) he
contributed, and for each L10 of money or provisions he added thereto,
another share. Two children between ten and sixteen would count as one
and be allowed a share in the division, but children under ten were to
have only fifty acres of wild land.  The scheme was admirable for its
equity, simplicity, and elasticity, and was equally so for either
capitalist or colonist.

Goodwin notes, that, �in an edition of Cushman�s �Discourse,� Judge Davis
of Boston advanced the idea that at first the Pilgrims put all their
possessions into a common stock, and until 1623 had no individual
property.  In his edition of Morton�s �Memorial� he honorably admits his
error.�  The same mistake was made by Robertson and Chief Justice
Marshall, and is occasionally repeated in this day.  �There was no
community of goods, though there was labor in common, with public
supplies of food and clothing.�  Neither is there warrant for the
conclusion of Goodwin, that because the holdings of the Planters� half
interest in the undertaking were divided into L10 shares, those of the
Adventurers were also.  It is not impossible, but it does not necessarily
follow, and certain known facts indicate the contrary.
