Wind fair.  All sail set.  SPEEDWELL in

to.  Found to be leaking badly. On

nearest port.  Laid course for Dartmouth

[Bradford, op. cit.  Deane�s ed. p. 68, note.  Russell (Pilgrim
Memorials, p. 15) says: �The ships put back into Dartmouth, August
13/23.�  Goodwin (op. cit.  p. 55) says: �The port was reached
about August 23.�  Captain John Smith strangely omits the return of
the ships to Dartmouth, and confuses dates, as he says �But the next
day after leaving Southampton the lesser ship sprung a leak that
forced their return to Plymouth,� etc.  Smith, New England�s Trials,
2d ed.  1622.  Cushman�s letter, written the 17th, says they had
then lain there �four days,� which would mean, if four full days,
the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th.]

SUNDAY, Aug. 13/23
Lying at anchor with SPEEDWELL leaking
badly in Dartmouth harbor.  No passengers,
except leaders, allowed ashore.

[Cushman in his letter to Edward Southworth, written at Dartmouth,
August 17, says that Martin, the �governour� of the passengers in
the MAY-FLOWER, �will not suffer them the passengers to go, ashore
lest they should run away.�  This probably applied especially to
such as had become disaffected by the delays and disasters, the
apprenticed (�bound�) servants, etc.  Of course no responsible
colonist would be thus restrained for the reason alleged.]
