Dr. Holmes has prettily pictured the �Departure� in his �Robinson of
Leyden,� even if not altogether correctly, geographically.

�He spake; with lingering, long embrace,
With tears of love and partings fond,
They floated down the creeping Maas,
Along the isle of Ysselmond.

�They passed the frowning towers of Briel,
The �Hook of Holland�s� shelf of sand,
And grated soon with lifting keel
The sullen shores of Fatherland.

�No home for these!  too well they knew
The mitred king behind the throne;
The sails were set, the pennons flew,
And westward ho! for worlds unknown.�


Winslow informs us that they of the Leyden congregation who volunteered
for the American enterprise were rather the smaller fraction of the whole
body, though he adds, as noted �that the difference was not great.�
A careful analysis of the approximate list of the Leyden colonists,
--including, of course, Carver, and Cushman and his family,--whose total
number seems to have been seventy-two, indicates that of this number,
forty-two, or considerably more than half (the rest being children,
seamen, or servants), were probably members of the Leyden church.  Of
these, thirty, probably, were males and twelve females.  The exact
proportion this number bore to the numerical strength of Robinson�s
church at that time cannot be determined, because while something less
than half as we know, gave their votes for the American undertaking, it
cannot be known whether or not the women of church had a vote in the
matter.  Presumably they did not, the primitive church gave good heed to
the words of Paul (i Corinthians xiv. 34), �Let your women keep silence
in the churches.�  Neither can it be known--if they had a voice--whether
the wives and daughters of some of the embarking Pilgrims, who did not go
themselves at this time, voted with their husbands and fathers for the
removal.  The total number, seventy-two, coincides very nearly with the
estimate made by Goodwin, who says: �Only eighty or ninety could go in
this party from Leyden,� and again: �Not more than eighty of the
MAY-FLOWER company were from Leyden.  Allowing for [i.e. leaving out]
the younger children and servants, it is evident that not half the
company can have been from Robinson�s congregation.�  As the total
number of passengers on the MAYFLOWER was one hundred and two when she
took her final departure from England, it is clear that Goodwin�s
estimate is substantially correct, and that the number representing the
Leyden church as given above, viz., forty-two, is very close to the
fact.
