Mrs. Alice Mullens, whose given name we know only from her husband�s
will, filed in London, we know little about.  Her age was (if she
was his first wife) presumably about that of her husband, whom she
survived but a short time.

Joseph Mullens was perhaps older than his sister Priscilla, and the third
child of his parents; but the impression prevails that he was
slightly her junior,--on what evidence it is hard to say.  That he
was sixteen is rendered certain by the fact that he is reckoned by
his father, in his will, as representing a share in the planter�s
half-interest in the colony, and to do so must have been of that
age.

Priscilla Mullens, whom the glamour of unfounded romance and the pen of
the poet Longfellow have made one of the best known and best beloved
of the Pilgrim band, was either a little older, or younger, than her
brother Joseph, it is not certain which.  But that she was over
sixteen is made certain by the same evidence as that named
concerning  her brother.

Robert Carter is named by Bradford as a �man-servant,� and Mrs. Austin,
in her imaginative �Standish of Standish,� which is never to be
taken too literally, has made him (see p. 181 of that book) �a dear
old servant,� whom Priscilla Mullens credits with carrying her in
his arms when a small child, etc.  Both Bradford�s mention and Mr.
Mullens�s will indicate that he was yet a young man and �needed
looking after.�  He did not sign the Compact, which of itself
indicates nonage, unless illness was the cause, of which, in his
case, there is no evidence, until later.

Richard Warren, as he had a wife and five pretty well grown daughters,
must have been forty-five or more when he came over.  He is
suggested to have been from Essex.

Stephen Hopkins is believed to have been a �lay-reader� with Mr. Buck,
chaplain to Governor Gates, of the Bermuda expedition of 1609 (see
Purchas, vol. iv.  p. 174).  As he could hardly have had this
appointment, or have taken the political stand he did, until  of
age, he must have been at least twenty-one at that time.  If so, he
would have been not less than thirty two years old in 1620, and was
probably considerably older, as his son Giles is represented by
Goodwin (�Pilgrim Republic,� p. 184) as being �about 15.�  If the
father was but twenty-one when the son was born, he must have been
at least thirty-seven when he became a MAY-FLOWER Pilgrim.  The
probabilities are that he was considerably older.  His English home
is not known.  Professor Arber makes an error (The Story of the
Pilgrim Fathers,� p. 261) in regard to Hopkins which, unless noted,
might lead to other and more serious mistakes.  Noting the
differences between John Pierce and a Master Hopkins, heard before
the Council for New England, May 5/15, 1623, Arber designates Master
Hopkins as �Stephen� (on what authority does not appear), and leaves
us to infer that it was the Pilgrim Hopkins. On further inquiry it
transpires that the person who was at variance with Master John
Pierce over the matter of passage and freight money, on account of
the unfortunate PARAGON, was a Rev. Master Hopkins (not Stephen of
the MAY-FLOWER), who, we learn from Neill�s �History of the Virginia
Company,� was �recommended July 3, 1622, by the Court of the Company
to the Governor of Virginia, .  .  . being desirous to go over at
his own charge.  He was evidently a passenger on both of the
disastrous attempts of the PARAGON under Captain William Pierce, and
being forced back the second time, apparently gave up the intention
of going.
