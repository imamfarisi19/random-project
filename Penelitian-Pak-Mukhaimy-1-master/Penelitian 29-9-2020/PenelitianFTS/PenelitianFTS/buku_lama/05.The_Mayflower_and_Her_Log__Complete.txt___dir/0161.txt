[We have seen that Christopher Martin was made �governour� of the
passengers on the MAY-FLOWER for the voyage, and Cushman
�assistant.�  It is evident from Cushman�s oft-quoted letter (see
ante) that Martin became obnoxious, before the ship reached
Dartmouth, to both passengers and crew.  It is also evident that
when the emigrants were all gathered in the MAY-FLOWER there was a
new choice of officers (though no record is found of it), as Cushman
vacated his place and went back to London, and we find that, as
noted before, on November 11 the colonists �confirmed� John Carver
as their �governour,� showing that he had been such hitherto.
Doubtless Martin was deposed at Southampton (perhaps put into
Cushman�s vacant place, and Carver made �governour� in his stead.)]

Same; and so without material change, the
daily record of wind, weather, and the
ship�s general course--the repetition of
which would be both useless and wearisome

vessel was near half the seas over.  Fine
warm weather and the �harvest-moon.�  The
usual equinoctial weather deferred.
