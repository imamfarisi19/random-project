[Edward Winslow gives us here another proof of that rare
self-sacrifice, that entire devotion to his work, and that splendid
intrepidity which so signally characterized his whole career.  At
this most critical moment, the fate of the little colony trembling
in the balance, when there was evident fear of treachery and
surprise on the part of both the English and the savages; though the
wife of his youth lay at the point of death (which came but two days
later), and his heart was heavy with grief; forgetting all but the
welfare of his little band of brethren, he goes forward alone, his
life in his hand, to meet the great sachem surrounded by his whole
tribe, as the calm, adroit diplomatist, upon whom all must depend;
and as the fearless hostage, to put himself in pawn for the savage
chief.]

The king, leaving Master Winslow with
brother, came over the brook, with some
twenty of his men, leaving their bows and
arrows behind them, and giving some six or
seven of their men as hostages for Master
Winslow.  Captain Standish, with Master
Williamson, the ship�s-merchant, as
interpreter,

[It would seem from the frequent mention of the presence of some of
the ship�s company, Master Jones, the �Masters-mates,� and now the
�ship�s-merchant,� that the ship was daily well represented in the
little settlement on shore.  The presence of Master Williamson on
this occasion is perhaps readily accounted for.  Every other meeting
with the Indians had been unexpected, the present one was
anticipated, and somewhat eagerly, for upon its successful issue
almost everything depended.  By this time Standish had probably
become aware that Tisquantum�s command of English was very limited,
and he desired all the aid the ship�s interpreter could give.  By
some means, the sachem and the colonists succeeded in establishing
on this day a very good and lasting understanding.]

and a guard of half a dozen musketeers, met
the king at the brook,

[The guard was probably made thus small to leave the body of the
colonists as strong a reserve force as possible to meet any surprise
attack on the part of the Indians.  Colonel Higginson, in his Book
of American Explorers, gives a cut of this meeting of Massasoit and
his pineses with Standish and his guard of honor, but it is
defective in that the guard seems to have advanced to the hill
(�Strawberry,� or later �Watson�s�) to meet the sachem, instead of
only to �the brook;� and more especially in that there are but two
officers with the �six musketeers,� where there ought to be three,
viz.  Standish, in command, Edward Window, as the envoy and hostage
(in full armor), and �Mr. Williamson,� the ship�s-merchant or
purser, as interpreter, perhaps acting as lieutenant of the guard.
It is always matter of regret when books, especially text-books,
written by authors of some repute, and published by reputable
houses, fail, for want of only a little care in the study of the
available history of events they pictorially represent, to make
their pictures and the known facts correspond.]
