Josselyn, in his �Two Voyages to New England,� gives as the result of the
experience and observations had in his voyages, but a few years later,
much that is interesting and of exceptional value as to the food and
equipment of passengers to, and colonists in, this part of America.  It
has especial interest, perhaps, for the author and his readers, in the
fact that Josselyn�s statements were not known until after the data given
in these pages had been independently worked out from various sources,
and came therefore as a gratifying confirmation of the conclusions
already reached.

Josselyn says as to food, as follows:--�The common proportion of
victuals for the sea to a mess (being 4 men) is as followeth:--

�2 pieces of Beef of 3 lb. 1/4 apiece.  Pork seems to have been
inadvertently omitted.

�Four pounds of Bread [ship-bread].

�One pint & 1/2 of Pease.

�Four Gallons of Bear [Beer], with mustard and vinegar for 3 flesh days
in the week.�


�For four fish days to each mess per day:--

�Two pieces of Codd or Haberdine, making 3 pieces of a fish, i.e.  a
dried salt cod being divided into three pieces, 2 of those pieces were to
be a day�s ration for 4 men.

�Four pounds of Bread.

�Three-quarters of a pound of cheese.

�Bear as before.�

�Oatmeal per day for 50 men 1 Gallon [dry], and so proportionable for
more or fewer.�

�Thus you see the ship�s provision is Beefe and Porke, Fish, Butter,
Cheese, Pease, Pottage, Water-Gruel, Bisket, and six shilling Bear.�


�For private fresh provision you may carry with you (in case you or any
of yours should be sick at sea):--

�Conserves of Roses, Clove-Gilliflowers, Wormwood, Green-Ginger,
Burnt-Wine, English Spirits, Prunes to stew, Raisons of the Sun,
Currence [currants], Sugar, Nutmeg, Mace, Cinnamon, Pepper and Ginger,
White Bisket, Butter, or �Captains biscuit,� made with wheat flour or
Spanish Rusk, Eggs, Rice, Juice of Lemons, well put up to cure or
prevent the Scurvy, Small Skillets, Pipkins, Porringers and small
Frying Pans.�
