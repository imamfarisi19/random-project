That a considerable �stock of trading goods� was included in the
MAY-FLOWER�S lading is mentioned by at least one writer, and that this
was a fact is confirmed by the records of the colonists� dealings with
the Indians, and the enumeration of not a few of the goods which could
have had, for the most part, no other use or value.  They consisted
largely of knives, bracelets (bead and metal), rings, scissors,
copper-chains, beads, �blue and red trading cloth,� cheap (glass) jewels
(�for the ears,� etc.), small mirrors, clothing (e. g. �red-cotton
horseman�s coats--laced,� jerkins, blankets, etc.), shoes, �strong
waters,� pipes, tobacco, tools and hard ware (hatchets, nails, hoes,
fish-hooks, etc.), rugs, twine, nets, etc., etc.  A fragment of one of
the heavy hoes of the ancient pattern--�found on the site of the
Pilgrim trading house at Manomet�--is owned by the Pilgrim Society, and
speaks volumes of the labor performed by the Pilgrims, before they had
ploughs and draught-cattle, in the raising of their wonderful crops of
corn. Such was the MAY-FLOWER�S burden, animate and inanimate, whe
--the last passenger and the last piece of freight transferred from the
SPEEDWELL--her anchor �hove short,� she swung with the tide in Plymouth
roadstead, ready to depart at last for �the Virginia plantations.�




CHAPTER IX

THE JOURNAL OF THE SHIP MAY-FLOWER

Thomas Jones, Master, from London, England, towards �Hudson�s River� in
Virginia

[The voyage of the MAY-FLOWER began at London, as her consort�s did
at Delfshaven, and though, as incident to the tatter�s brief career,
we have been obliged to take note of some of the happenings to the
larger ship and her company (at Southampton, etc.), out of due
course and time, they have been recited only because of their
insuperable relation to the consort and her company, and not as part
of the MAY-FLOWER�S own proper record]


SATURDAY, July 15/25, 1620
Gravesend.  Finished lading.  Got
passengers aboard  and got under way for
Southampton.  Dropped down the Thames to
Gravesend with the tide.
