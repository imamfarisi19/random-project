Bradford states that they used their �curtlaxes� (cutlasses) to dig the
frozen ground to get at the Indians� corn, �having forgotten to bring
spade or mattock.�  �Daggers� are mentioned as used in their celebrated
duel by Dotey and Leister, servants of Stephen Hopkins.  Bradford
narrates that on one of their exploring tours on the Cape the length of
guard duty performed at night by each �relief� was determined by the
inches of slow-match burned (�every one standing when his turn came
while five or six inches of match was burning�), clearly indicating that
they had no watches with them.  The �drum� and �trumpet� are both
mentioned in �Mourt�s Relation� in the account given of Massasoit�s
reception, the latter as eliciting the especial attention of his men, and
their efforts at blowing it.

The Ordnance (cannon) brought in the ship consisted (probably) of ten
guns, certainly of six.  Of these, two (2) were �sakers,�--guns ten feet
long of 3 to 4 inches bore, weighing from fifteen to eighteen hundred
pounds each; two (2) were �minions� (or �falcons�),--guns of 3 1/2 inch
bore, weighing twelve hundred pounds (1200 lbs.) each; and two (2) were
�bases,�--small guns of 1 1/4 inch bore, weighing some three hundred
pounds (300 lbs.) each.  These were mounted on �the Hill� fort or
platform.  It is probable that besides these were the four smallest
cannon, called �patereros� (or �murderers�), which, at the time of De
Rasiere�s visit to Plymouth in 1627, were mounted on a platform (in front
of the Governor�s house), at the intersection of the two streets of the
town, and commanded its several approaches.  It is not likely that they
were sent for after 1621, because the Adventurers were never in mood to
send if asked, while Bradford, in speaking of the first alarm by the
Indians, says, �This caused us to plant our great ordnance in places most
convenient,� leaving a possible inference that they had smaller ordnance
in reserve.  With this ordnance was of course a proper supply of
ammunition adapted to its use.  The �sakers� are said to have carried a
four-pound ball, the �minions� a three-pound ball, and the �bases� a ball
of a pound weight.  There is not entire agreement between authorities, in
regard to the size, weight, and calibre of these different classes of
early ordnance, or the weight of metal thrown by them, but the above are
approximate data, gathered from careful comparison of the figures given
by several.  There is no doubt that with this heavy ordnance and
ammunition they stowed among their ballast and dunnage (as was the case
in Higginson�s ships), their �spare chains and anchors, chalk, bricks,
sea-coal (for blacksmithing), iron, steel, lead, copper, red-lead, salt,�
etc.; all of which they also necessarily had, and from their bulk,
character, and weight, would stow as low in the ship as might be.
