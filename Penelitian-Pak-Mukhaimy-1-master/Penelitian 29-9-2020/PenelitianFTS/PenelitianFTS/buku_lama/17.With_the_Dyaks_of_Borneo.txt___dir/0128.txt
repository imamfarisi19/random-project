"Walk back to the swamp slowly, and keep in hiding all the time," he
said as he turned about. "Then they will not be able to rush us, and we
shall reach our boats in safety. I will keep in your centre, so that
all may know that I am with you. As for you, Tyler Richardson," he
shouted over his shoulder, "you have beaten me this time, and have won
handsomely; but you shall know what it is to be hunted. I tell you that
I will sail at once to my friends, and when I return it will be with
hundreds. Yes, hundreds shall come who will be willing and eager to do
my bidding. Then I will follow across the land, even as far as Sarawak,
where your countryman has set up his rule. And more than that, I will
cut off your journey on the way, for there are rivers to be crossed,
my friend, and you shall find that some of the sea Dyaks are there to
stop you and to fall upon their brothers of the land, whom they hate
and whose heads they long for. Adieu for the present! Soon, very soon,
I shall have your head, and then I tell you that I will place it in a
basket and hang it at the foretop of the prahu so that all who care can
see what is the fate of a beggarly Englishman."

"I will not deign to answer," said Tyler in Li Sung's ear. "He is full
of threats and nothing more. I do not fear him, and as for this tale
of more men, I do not believe that he has them. It is more than likely
that he is merely trying to frighten me, and that until I search for him
myself and come upon him I shall not see him again. He has been badly
beaten, and he will do all that he can after this to keep out of the
way. But he shall not escape, for he is a murderer, and I owe it to my
dead friend to follow till he is taken."

"Den it must be later on," answered Li Sung, elevating his eyebrows and
looking at his young leader with wrinkled brow. "Listen, massa, and Li
Sung him tellee you little ting about de Dutchman. He say he comee after
you wid plenty much men. Him speakee de truth."
