Some two hours later, when the sun was overhead, and a hot haze hung
over the water, a sampan was seen to be rowing from the creek upon the
banks of which the Chinese town was situated, and was observed to
direct its course towards the _Dido_. At first the marine who was doing
sentry-go at the summit of the gangway paused listlessly in his weary
tramp, glad of anything, however small, which would break the monotony
of his hours of duty, and favoured the craft with a half-pitying gaze.
Then he stifled a yawn, remarked upon the heat and discomfort of such
latitudes when compared to Old England, and would have pursued his
beat had not a second movement on the part of the sampan attracted his
attention.

"Well, that does for me!" he exclaimed, bringing his musket from the
shoulder to the deck with a clash which startled the mid-day silence.
"Making this way against orders! All these here blacks, and the China
boys too, know well that the rule is that they are not to come alongside
unless a chief or big gun o' some sort is along with 'em. And here's
a sampan, with a couple of cheeky chaps aboard, making direct for us!
Who knows? they might have a keg of powder aboard. Hi, you two monkeys!
Clear right off, or I'll--!"

He brought the butt of his musket to his shoulder and made pretence to
aim. Then, as the Chinaman who occupied a seat in front of the one who
was plying the oars rose to his feet and faced about, the sentry came to
the rail, and leaned over it to inspect the craft and its contents more
closely.

"It ain't no use yer kow-towing," he called out, seeing that the
individual who had just risen to his feet was bowing to him. "I tell yer
that it ain't allowed, so clear off, and quick about it too."

Whether the Chinaman understood what was said it would be difficult to
state, but it would appear as though he did, for he at once thrust his
hand into the interior of his capacious coat and produced a document,
which he held above his head.
