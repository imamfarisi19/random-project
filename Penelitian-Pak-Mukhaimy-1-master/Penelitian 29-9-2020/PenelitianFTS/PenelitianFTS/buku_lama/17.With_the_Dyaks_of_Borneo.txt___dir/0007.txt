"May I go aboard?" he asked. "I hear that you carry a cargo of grain,
and I'm anxious to see how it's loaded."

"Then you've come at the right moment, sir," was the answer. "Step right
aboard, and look round as much as you want. We've been terrible hard
at work these last two days getting a cargo of cotton ashore, and now
we've just hove up the lower hatches, and shall be taking the grain out
of her when dinner's finished. It's come all this way for your naval
johnnies--at least that's what the boss has given me to understand;
and we are expecting a party of officers along any moment to take a
look at the stuff. I suppose they'll pass it right away, for it's good
right down to the keel. Then these fellows will tackle it with shovels
and bags, and you will see they'll hoist it up in a twinkling. Helloo!
Blessed if that ain't the party coming along this way!"

He turned, and indicated his meaning by a nod of his head in the
direction of three smartly-dressed naval officers who had just put in an
appearance.

"The party right enough," he said. "Just excuse me, sir, and get right
aboard if you care to."

Having obtained permission to go aboard, Tyler at once stepped to the
gangway, and was quickly upon the deck. Then he went to the hatchway,
which occupied a large square in the centre of the vessel, and leant
over the combing so as to obtain a good view of the scene below. Beneath
was a lower deck and a second hatchway of similar dimensions, the
covering of which had evidently been recently removed. A glance showed
him that the hold was filled with loose grain to within some six feet of
the hatchway, and he was occupied in wondering how many sacks of corn
had been necessary to fill it, when he was aroused by a voice at his
elbow. Turning swiftly, he found the three naval officers and the mate
standing beside him.

"A fine cargo, and in splendid condition," the latter was saying. "We've
just hove up the hatches for your inspection, and that's the way down."
