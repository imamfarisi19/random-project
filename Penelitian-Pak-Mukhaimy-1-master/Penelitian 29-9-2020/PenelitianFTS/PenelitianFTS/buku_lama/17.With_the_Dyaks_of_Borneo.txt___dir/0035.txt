"A derelict," explained the shipping agent, who had accompanied them
to the quay. "She was found off the northern coast of Sumatra, driving
hither and thither upon the sea. No one can say to whom she belonged,
or how it happened that she was adrift and left all alone. Perhaps her
crew went ashore somewhere in the Archipelago and were set upon by the
natives. But it is idle to guess, and all that I can tell you is that
she was salvaged by a vessel making for this port, and that the usual
period allowed in these cases having passed without a claimant coming
forward, she is now to be sold by auction, or to any private bidder
who will give the price. There, sir, you can see what handsome lines
she has, and I can assure you that she is sound and seaworthy. I have
already mentioned the figure asked for her, and you are at liberty to
take her out for a day's cruise before coming to a definite decision.
Shall I make the necessary arrangements and place a crew aboard?"

"I like her looks," said Mr. Beverley, "and we will try her. When can
you be ready?"

"To-morrow morning shall see all arrangements completed, and I myself
will come with you," replied the agent. "And now as to the other
questions which you put to me. I can find you ten men to form a crew
with the greatest ease, and I happen to know of a young fellow who would
gladly go with you as boatswain. He was a sailor aboard a merchantman,
but fell sick when the ship lay here discharging her cargo, and was
at once taken to the hospital, where he remained for long after the
ship had sailed. He is now well and strong, and eagerly looking for
some work. His name is John Marshall, and I can give him an excellent
character."

"Then if I like him I will engage him for the trip," said Mr. Beverley;
"but what about an interpreter? It will be necessary to take someone
with us who can speak the Dyak language, and I think that amongst the
Malay crew should be included natives who speak some English besides
their own tongue."
