"Marines to remain in the pinnace and keep up a musketry fire," cried
the lieutenant in the calmest tones. "Men of the _Dido_ to climb the
bank and take up position there."

In a moment the tars were over the side, wading through the shallow
water, and ere long had scrambled to the level of the jungle.

"A few minutes with their cutlasses would be a good thing, I think," the
Rajah ventured to suggest. "I know these pirates well, and if you leave
them cover through which to crawl they will be a constant danger and
annoyance."

"Quite so, and many thanks, Rajah! I had not thought of that. Now,
lads," continued the lieutenant, "all lie down and get your muskets
ready. Mr. Richardson, take a party of twelve forward, and cut down the
reeds and grass within thirty yards."

It seemed quite natural to Tyler to touch his cap and answer "Ay,
ay, sir," and then, picking his men haphazard, he went to carry out
the order. When that was done, the marines and sailors lay down flat
upon the ground, firing now and again, but only when a figure showed
itself. And round about them every tree hid an enemy, while the jungle
was alive with the voices of the pirates, and the incessant jangle of
gongs and the beat of war-drums. Spears flashed in the sunlight, cast
by hands which could not be seen, while a shower of darts and arrows
hissed through the air and struck the ground within a few inches of the
defenders. And, drowning every other sound, the twelve-pounder every now
and again spoke out, as it sent a charge of grape amidst the pirates.

When darkness came it found Tyler and his friends in sorry plight,
surrounded by enemies, and deafened by the clamour which came from every
quarter of the jungle.




CHAPTER XX

The End of the Chase


"Ahoy there! Horton, ahoy! Where are you, Rajah?" Strangely weird and
uncanny did the sounds appear as they left the lips of Captain Keppel
and floated across the rushing stream away into the jungle. "Ahoy! Ahoy!"
