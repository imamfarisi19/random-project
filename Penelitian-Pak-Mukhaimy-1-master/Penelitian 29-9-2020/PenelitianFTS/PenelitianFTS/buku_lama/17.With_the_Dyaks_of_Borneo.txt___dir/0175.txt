"It must be done," he kept saying to himself as he was being wafted to
the opposite shore, "and after all, why should I not be successful?
for the part which has already been carried out so silently has been
far larger and more full of difficulties, and yet see how smoothly it
has worked. Yes, I will rescue those two helpless prisoners whatever
happens."

With this resolution before him he became calmer and more at his ease,
and prepared to set about the task in a manner which at once showed that
he was full of courage and determination.

"Stand ready to embark rapidly," he said, as he crept to John Marshall
and lay down beside him in the darkness. "If you hear me shout you will
know that I require help, but otherwise you are not to come nearer to
the stockade. Now I am going, but before I go I will remind you that
this company will embark on the English vessel which the pirates towed
in. Men have already made a small prahu fast to her bows, and once the
signal is given, and we are aboard, they will cut the cables and swing
her round. After that she will be carried down by the stream."

"And it won't be long afore we get some of her canvas up," whispered the
sailor. "Then if this here Dutchman and his men come after us, or any
of them coves down the river attempt to stop us, why, we shall be able
to tackle 'em in proper style. Now, sir, be careful, please, for you're
our leader. Jest think of that, for these here Dyaks jest think a deal
of yer and would be sorry if yer came to harm. There's me, too, you
must remember"--and the honest fellow felt for Tyler's hand and gripped
it firmly,--"what would I do to get on without yer? But you'll take
the best of care, that I'm sure of, and you'll carry this through like
the rest. If yer shout I'll be there in a twinkling, and if yer should
happen to come up with that Dutch chap, jest think of how I downed him.
Put yer fist in his face, and it'll silence him sooner than anything.
Good-bye, and good luck!"
