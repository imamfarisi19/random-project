For Tyler there was little merry-making, for a bullet had struck him in
the elbow as he charged against the stockade at Rembas, and that same
evening he had lain in an open boat, with teeth fast set, while the
surgeons amputated the limb. But he had gone through so much already
that this was not likely to disturb him very much. Indeed, within a
month he was up and about, and ere long back at his duty.

Years have passed since then, and the lad who went down into the hold
of the grain ship alone to rescue the unconscious officers, and who
afterwards led a tribe of Dyaks in far-away Borneo, is an old man, who
steps with far less agility than in those young days. But the old spirit
is there. The white beard and moustache, with their decidedly nautical
cut, cannot disguise the square chin and the firm lips. The eyes sparkle
as of yore, and return a glance without flinching, while even now there
is a swing in the shoulders, a poise of the head, which distinguishes
Tyler. Yes, in spite of the loss of an arm, he has led a life of
activity, and has only recently settled down to enjoy the remainder of
his allotted years peacefully and in quietness. In his time, while
on active service with the Royal Navy, he has seen much fighting, has
experienced many an adventure. But it is safe to say that never has he
encountered so much danger as in the old days, when fighting close to
the men of the _Dido_ and with the Dyaks of Borneo.
