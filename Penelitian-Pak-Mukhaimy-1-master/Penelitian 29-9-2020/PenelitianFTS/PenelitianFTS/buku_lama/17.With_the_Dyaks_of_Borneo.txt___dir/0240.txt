"But supposing they are spies?" demanded another. "We know that those
at Sarawak, under the tuan besar (great chief--James Brooke), are
about to attack us, and no doubt they will send some here to see what
preparations we are making; not that we need trouble ourselves, for
they will certainly be beaten. Still, of what use is it to call men who
are spies, for will they descend and come to us like children when they
know that within a minute they will be kneeling before us with their
hands lashed, while one of our number stands above them with his sword
and prepares to sever their necks? Call if you wish, but you waste your
breath."

"That we will see," was the answer, "but if there be no answer you shall
be the first to climb, for I as the leader give you the order. Now,
cease chattering while I shout."

Stepping to a large boulder which lay near at hand he leapt upon it,
and, placing a hand to his mouth, shouted at the top of his voice,
telling those who might be hidden above to come down at once.

"It is useless for you to remain," he said, "for we are ten while you
are but two, and also there are hundreds to follow us. Come then
quietly, for the end will be the same whatever you do. You are caught,
and we claim you as our prisoners."

"Let him claim and shout as much as he likes," said Tyler, with a
reckless laugh, as Li Sung whispered the message in his ear, "I don't
care to hand myself over; for the idea of cold steel and a severed neck
is not enticing. We will just lie perfectly still till we are obliged
to make a move, and then let our action be swift. See here, Li. I will
raise this big boulder upon the wall just where this bush covers the
front. Then, when one of the attackers happens to cross the line it will
follow, I will heave it over and step back at once. You can pick one of
them off with the sling with the same smartness, and perhaps they will
fail to discover our exact position. Look out! That fellow is shouting
again."
