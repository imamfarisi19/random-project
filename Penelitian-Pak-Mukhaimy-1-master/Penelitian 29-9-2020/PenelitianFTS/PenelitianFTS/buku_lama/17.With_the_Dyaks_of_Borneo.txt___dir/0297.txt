"We are close on them," he said in calm tones. "I remember that there
is a hill on the left, some little distance from the main stockade, and
that it has a fort on top. That is where the noise comes from."

"And here we are in sight," exclaimed the Rajah. "Now we can prepare for
a peppering with slugs. But we are a bad mark to aim at, for the stream
is sweeping us on at a pace. Keep a sharp look-out, for it is about here
that we shall run upon a boom, and it would be bad for us if we became
entangled. They will have the range to a nicety, you may be sure, and
they would blow us out of the water."

The warning was given in the calmest of tones, for the Rajah was no
alarmist, but a man of great courage and a tried soldier. Gripping his
helm he steered the gig up the very centre of the stream, and as he
reached the bend ahead shot her over to the farther side.

"There may be skulkers lying on the edge of the bank," he remarked, "and
they would have us within easy range. Ah, listen to that!"

So swift was the current that the banks seemed to leap past them,
and long before those aboard had time to consider what was about to
happen, or realize the fact that they were practically alone, a wide
interval separating them from the other boats and the main part of the
expedition, the gig had swung round the bend and was in full sight of
the enemy. A thousand of them, or thereabouts, lined the hill, and set
up a yell of defiance which caused even the boldest of the attackers
to change colour. Rushing hither and thither, and filling the air with
their cries, the pirates watched the gig advance, while some of their
comrades, as if to add to the note of defiance already sent up, danced a
mad war-fling on the roof of the fort erected on the summit of the hill.

"Number one," said the captain coolly, emptying one of the barrels of
his gun at the multitude. "But those are not the fellows we have to deal
with just now. We are for the main stockade."
