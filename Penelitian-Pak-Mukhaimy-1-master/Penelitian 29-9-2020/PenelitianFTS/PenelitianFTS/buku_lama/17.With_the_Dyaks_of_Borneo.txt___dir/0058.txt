Thanks to the light shed by the riding-lamp, both he and John Marshall
could see the Malays grouped upon the deck, and could watch as their
leader, Christian van Sonerell, went amongst them, urging them to dash
aft and fall upon the white men. At length, rendered desperate and
utterly reckless by the precarious position in which he found himself,
Tyler levelled his pistol at the leader of the pirates, and taking
deliberate aim, pressed steadily upon the trigger. At once there was
a shout, and the Dutchman swung round with a curse, showing that the
bullet had struck him. Indeed, there was little doubt that he was
heavily hit, for he staggered to one side, and would have fallen had it
not been for the mast against which he placed one hand. But he was a
sturdy fellow, this rascally marauder, and to do him but common justice
he was not the man to cry out till badly hurt, or to give in till
thoroughly beaten. With a gasp, therefore, he recovered his breath, and
at once leapt in front of his following.

"At them!" he shouted. "Get together on this side and rush at them in a
body. Now, I will lead you."

Turning for one moment to his men, he swung round in the direction of
the stern, and as if to show his hatred of the white men, he levelled
a pistol and fired, sending a bullet swishing so close to Tyler's head
that the latter stepped aside involuntarily. Then, tossing the weapon
to the deck, he drew a cutlass from his belt, and, snatching a second
pistol with his left hand, led the pirates in a mad rush towards their
victims.

"Some are hanging back," shouted Tyler, "so I will do as I said. If they
come on too strongly it will be madness to wait, and I shall fire the
gun and then do my best with my pistol."

"And what then?" demanded John Marshall eagerly. "Are we to stay here on
the deck and get sliced to pieces? Why, it's throwing our lives away!"

"What else can we do?" said Tyler eagerly. "We are hemmed in, so far as
I can see, and have no means of flight."
