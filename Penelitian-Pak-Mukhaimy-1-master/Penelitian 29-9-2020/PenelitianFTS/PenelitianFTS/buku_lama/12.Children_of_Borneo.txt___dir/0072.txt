THE TRANSFORMATION OF HAWAII: How Fifty Years of Mission Work gave a
Christian Nation to the World. Told for Young People. By BELLE M. BRAIN.
Crown 8vo, art linen, illustrated 3s 6d

"Much is said against missions, sometimes in ignorance, sometimes
from mistaken conviction, and not seldom, it is to be feared, from
dislike of Christian morality; but the contrast between the Hawaii
which Cook discovered, and still more the Hawaii of forty odd
years of relations with white visitors, before the missionaries
came, and the Hawaii of 1870, is not lightly to be put
aside."--_Spectator._
