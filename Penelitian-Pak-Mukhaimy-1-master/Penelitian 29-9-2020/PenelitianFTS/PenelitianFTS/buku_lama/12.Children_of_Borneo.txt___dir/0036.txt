"I shall be able to master him, whoever he is," said the Deer. "If he
refuses to do what I wish, I shall punish him with my sharp horns."

So the others went out fishing, leaving the Deer at home. Soon he heard
the tramp of someone coming to the foot of the ladder leading up into
the hut, and a voice called out:

"Is anyone at home?"

"I am here," said the Deer. Looking out he saw a great giant, and his
heart failed him. He wished he had asked one of his companions to stay
with him.

"I smell some fish," said the Giant. "I want some, and you must give it
to me at once. I am hungry. Let me have what I want."

"It does not belong to me," said the Deer, in great fear. "It belongs to
the Pig, the Bear, the Tiger, and the Mouse-deer. They would punish me
severely if I gave any of it to you."

"Don't talk to me in that way," said the Giant, impatiently. "If you do
not let me have what I want, I will eat you up."

The Deer was too frightened of the Giant to refuse his request, so he
let him eat the fish, and take some away with him.

When his companions returned, the Deer gave them his account of the
Giant's visit. They blamed him for his cowardice, and the Wild Boar said
he would keep watch the next day.

"If the Giant comes," said he, "I will gore him with my tusks, and
trample him underfoot."

But he fared no better than the Deer, for when he saw the Giant, who
threatened to kill him if he refused to give him some fish, he was
afraid, and let him take as much as he wanted.

Great was the disgust of the others to find on their return that their
fish had again been taken.

"Let me watch," said the Bear. "No Giant shall frighten me. I will hug
him with my strong arms, and scratch him with my sharp claws."

So Bruin was left in charge the next day, while the others went out to
fish.

Soon he heard the Giant who came to the foot of the steps, and shouted:
"Hullo! Who's there?"

"I am," said the Bear. "Who are you, and what do you want?"
