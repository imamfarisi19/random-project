SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

"Contains probably the most intimate and comprehensive account that has
yet appeared of the Sea Dyaks of Sarawak.... It is so pleasantly written
that the reader forgets that it is learned."--_The Times._

"We heartily commend this book to the learned public."--_The Athen√¶um._

"The author has been completely successful."--_The Bookman._

"Pleasant to read, and gives a really good account of an interesting
race."--_The Illustrated London News._

"Mr Gomes is a skilled and gifted investigator, and his book is a
valuable contribution to Eastern anthropology."--_The Outlook._

"Let our quotations serve to introduce a book as fascinating as it is
authoritative."--_The Sketch._

"Mr Gomes' book is no hasty piece of work; it is the result of seventeen
years spent in Sarawak.... Mr Gomes gives a very full account of the
whole culture and life of the Sea Dyaks."--_The Saturday Review._

"It is emphatically good. Mr Gomes speaks as one having authority. He
has certainly unique experience, sympathy, insight, comprehension, a
sense of proportion, and he is not without the quality of humour and
dramatic instinct, and his style, simple and clear, is not without
literary distinction. He has produced a book that ought to take high
rank."--_The Englishman (Calcutta)._

"Mr E. H. Gomes' absorbing book."--_The Daily Mail._
