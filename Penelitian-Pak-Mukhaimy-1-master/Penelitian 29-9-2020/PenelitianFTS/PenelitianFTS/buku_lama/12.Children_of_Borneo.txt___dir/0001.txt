I gratefully acknowledge the permission readily
granted by Messrs Seeley & Co. Ltd., to make use of
much matter that has already been published in my
book, "Seventeen Years Among the Sea Dyaks of
Borneo," and I would recommend that book to those
who wish for more information about Borneo and its
inhabitants.
