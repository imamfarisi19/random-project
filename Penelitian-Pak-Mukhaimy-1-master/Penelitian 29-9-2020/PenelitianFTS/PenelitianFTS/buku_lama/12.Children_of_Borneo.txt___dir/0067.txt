The Discourses, commonly known as the Analects, contain the
sayings of the Sage as recorded by his disciples. The Analects
holds a somewhat similar relation to the Confucian Classics that
the synoptic books of the New Testament hold to the whole Bible,
and, like the Gospels, is the most popular book of the Canon.

A satisfactory account of the Earliest Religion of China can be

"'The time,' writes Dr Martin, 'is not, I trust, far distant when
the language of China will find a place in all our principal seats
of learning, and when her classic writers will be known and
appreciated. Nothing should tend more to hasten the advent of that
time than the broad sympathy, informed with knowledge, which
enables writers like Dr Martin to show how much of human interest
attaches to 'The Lore of Cathay.'"--_The Times._
