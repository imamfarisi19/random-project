organization and the methods of fighting have alike changed. It is
only those who have had responsibilities as leaders in the present
war whose instructions can be accepted as authoritative.

practice cruises, physical training, medical care, athletics,
recreations, and the career that the Navy affords one after
graduation are related in a manner that will make the midshipman's
