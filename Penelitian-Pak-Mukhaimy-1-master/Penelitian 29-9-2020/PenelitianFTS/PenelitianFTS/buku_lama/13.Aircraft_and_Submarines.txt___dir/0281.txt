THE MAKING OF A MODERN ARMY

And Its Operations in the Field

A Study Bated on the Experience of
Three Years on the French Front
1914-1917

René Radiguet
Général de Division, Army of France

Translated by
Henry P. du Bellet
Formerly American Consul at Rheims

_12{o}. 18 Illustrations and Diagrams. $1.50 net.
By mail, $1.65_

The younger Americans who are now in training for active service in
the field, and particularly those who have secured commissions as
officers or who are preparing to compete for such commissions, will
have a very direct interest in the instructions and suggestions
presented by General Radiguet in regard to the organization of an
army and the method of its operations in the field. General
Radiguet's treatise is based upon a varied experience in the
campaigns of the present war.
