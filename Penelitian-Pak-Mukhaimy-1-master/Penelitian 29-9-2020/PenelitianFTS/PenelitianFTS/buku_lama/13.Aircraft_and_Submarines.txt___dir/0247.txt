Many cruel sufferings befell seafaring people during the period of
German ruthlessness on the high seas. An open boat, overcrowded with
refugees, hastily provisioned as the ship to which it belonged was
careening to its fate, and tossing on the open sea two or three
hundred miles from shore in the icy nights of midwinter was no place
of safety or of comfort. Yet the Germans so construed it, holding
that when they gave passengers and crew of a ship time to take to
the boats, they had fully complied with the international law
providing that in the event of sinking a ship its people must first
be given an opportunity to assure their safety.

There have been many harrowing stories of the experiences of
survivors thus turned adrift. Under the auspices of the British
government, Rudyard Kipling wrote a book detailing the agonies which
the practice inflicted upon helpless human beings, including many
women and children. Some of the survivors have told in graphic story
the record of their actual experiences. Among these one of the most
vivid is from the pen of a well-known American journalist, Floyd P.
Gibbons, correspondent of the Chicago _Tribune_. He was saved from
the British liner, _Laconia_, sunk by a German submarine, and thus
tells the tale of his sufferings and final rescue:

I have serious doubts whether this is a real story. I am not
entirely certain that it is not all a dream and that in a few
minutes I will wake up back in stateroom B. 19 on the promenade
deck of the Cunarder _Laconia_ and hear my cockney steward
informing me with an abundance of "and sirs" that it is a fine
morning.

I am writing this within thirty minutes after stepping on the
dock here in Queenstown from the British mine sweeper which
picked up our open lifeboat after an eventful six hours of
drifting, and darkness and baling and pulling on the oars and of
straining aching eyes toward that empty, meaningless horizon in
search of help. But, dream or fact, here it is:
