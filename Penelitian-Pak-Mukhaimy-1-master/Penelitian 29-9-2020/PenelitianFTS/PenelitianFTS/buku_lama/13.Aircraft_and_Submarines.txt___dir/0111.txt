Airmen are not, as a rule, of a romantic or a literary temperament.
Pursuing what seems to the onlooker to be the most adventurous and
exhilarating of all forms of military service, they have been chary
of telling their experiences and singularly set upon treating them
as all in the day's work and eliminating all that is picturesque
from their narratives. Sergeant James R. McConnell, one of the
Americans in the French flying corps, afterwards killed, tells of a
day's service in his most readable book, _Flying for France_, in a
way that gives some idea of the daily routine of an operator of an
_avion de chasse_. He is starting just as the sky at dawn is showing
a faint pink toward the eastern horizon, for the aviator's work is
best done in early morning when, as a rule, the sky is clear and the
wind light:

Drawing forward out of line, you put on full power, race across
the grass, and take the air. The ground drops as the hood slants
up before you and you seem to be going more and more slowly as
you rise. At a great height you hardly realize you are moving.
You glance at the clock to note the time of your departure, and
at the oil gauge to see its throb. The altimeter registers 650
feet. You turn and look back at the field below and see others
leaving.

In three minutes you are at about four thousand feet. You have
been making wide circles over the field and watching the other
machines. At forty-five hundred feet you throttle down and wait
on that level for your companions to catch up. Soon the
escadrille is bunched and off for the lines. You begin climbing
again, gulping to clear your ears in the changing pressure.
Surveying the other machines, you recognize the pilot of each by
the marks on its side--or by the way he flies.
