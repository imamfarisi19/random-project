1. The manuscript forwarded with this letter has been examined in
the War College Division and the opinion given that it has
exceptional merit, presenting the principles governing trench
warfare in such a clear and logical manner that the publication,
with some changes and additions,[7] will be of considerable value to
our Officers.

[Footnote 7: These changes have been made.]

2. You are directed to confer with the Chief of the War College
Division regarding the effecting of the changes desired.

By order of the Secretary of War
(Signed) F. W. Lewis
Adjutant General.
