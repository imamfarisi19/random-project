In the January, 1899, issue of _McClure's Magazine_ there appeared a
profusely illustrated article entitled "Voyaging under the Sea." The
first part of it, "The Submarine Boat _Argonaut_ and her
Achievements," was written by Simon Lake himself. In it he quotes
as follows from the log book of the _Argonaut_ under date of July
28, 1898.

Submerged at 8.20 A. M. in about thirty feet of water.
Temperature in living compartment, eighty-three degrees
Fahrenheit. Compass bearing west-north-west, one quarter west.
Quite a lively sea running on the surface, also strong current.
At 10.45 A. M. shut down engine; temperature, eighty-eight
degrees Fahrenheit.

After engine was shut down, we could hear the wind blowing past
our pipes extending above the surface; we could also tell by the
sound when any steamers were in the vicinity. We first allowed
the boat to settle gradually to the bottom, with the tide running
ebb; after a time the tide changed, and she would work slightly
sideways; we admitted about four hundred pounds of water
additional, but she still would move occasionally, so that a
pendulum nine inches long would sway one eighth of an inch
(thwartship). At 12 o'clock (noon) temperature was eighty-seven
degrees Fahrenheit; at 2.45 P. M. the temperature was still
eighty-seven degrees Fahrenheit. There were no signs of carbonic
acid gas at 2.45, although the engine had been closed down for
three hours and no fresh air had been admitted during the time.
Could hear the whistle of boats on the surface, and also their
propellers when running close, to the boat. At 3.30 the
temperature had dropped to eighty-five degrees. At 3.45 found a
little sign of carbonic acid gas, very slight, however, as a
candle would burn fairly bright in the pits. Thought we could
detect a smell of gasoline by comparing the fresh air which came
down the pipe (when hand blower was turned). Storage lamps were
burning during the five hours of submergence, while engine was
not running.
