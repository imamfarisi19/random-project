All these parallelisms, in the modes of thinking, among men in far
removed quarters of the earth, do not, I think, necessarily imply that
there has been a transmission of thought from one race to the other, but
that there is a certain round of thought through which the brain leads
us, and in development we must all have followed along the same path.
Some races have made more rapid strides than others, possibly owing to
natural surroundings, and in their strides have left the others
centuries behind. Almost within the memory of our grandfathers, in this
country, witches were burned, and from this there is only a step back to
the Dayong of Borneo. Indeed, whosoever sees these people and lives with
them their everyday life, must regard them, after a not very long time,
merely as backward pupils in the school of life. Let me say in
conclusion, that he would have an unresponsive heart that could not feel
linked in a bond of fellowship with these people, and that God has made
of only one blood all nations of the earth, when he hears a Bornean
mother crooning her child to sleep with words identical in sentiment
with "Rock-a-bye Baby,"--what though the mother's earlobes are elongated
many an inch by heavy copper rings, her arms tattooed to the elbow, and
her blackened teeth filed to points. Once upon a time I heard a Kayan
mother soothing her little baby to sleep, and the words of the lullaby
which I learned are as follows:--


From the River's mouth the birds are straying,
And the Baiyo's topmost leaves are swaying;
The little chicks cheep,
Now my little one sleep,
For the black house-lizard, with glittering eye,
And the gray-haired Laki Laieng are nigh!
Sleep, dear little one, sleep!


For those philologically inclined I append the original:--


Lung koh madang Manoh
Migieong ujong Baiyo
Mensip anak Yap
Lamate Telyap, Telyap abing,
Lamate Laki Laieng oban!
Ara we we ara!
