"Oh so," said van Gulpendam, with a laugh, "the babah has come on
business, has he?"

"That is why," said the Chinaman lowering his voice, "I was so anxious
that no one should see me slipping into the garden of the Residence."

Van Gulpendam pricked his ears.

"You are very mysterious, babah," said he, "have you come to bother
me again about that confounded opium?"

"Yes, Kandjeng toean, and for something else besides."

"Very well, babah, let us hear what you have to say." He had it on the
tip of his tongue to call out, "Very well, babah, haul away," and,
had he at the moment known how to get it out in Malay, out it would
have come. But he had time to reflect that the Chinaman would not,
in any case, have appreciated the force of the nautical phrase.

Babah Lim Yang Bing, then, in his oily fashion proceeded to give his
version of the seizure of opium near the djaga monjet in the Moeara
Tjatjing, and made some attempt to explain to the Resident that what
had been seized there was in reality no opium at all.

"Oh, indeed," laughed van Gulpendam, "that is your tack is it? It
was not opium--what was it then?"

"Oh, Kandjeng toean," smiled the other, "it was nothing but scrapings
of opium pipes mixed with the thickened juice of certain plants."

"Well," said the Resident in a mocking tone of voice, "if that be so,
then there is an end of the matter, then there is nothing illegal at
all in it."

"Yes, yes," replied the other, "but the inspector of police insists
that it is opium."

"The deuce he does!" said van Gulpendam.

"Yes," said the Chinaman, "and he has consulted a couple of Chinese
experts, and these, not knowing where the stuff came from, and judging
by the smell and the taste have come to the conclusion, and have
publicly declared, that it is first class tjandoe, very superior to
that which the government supplies us farmers with."

"You mean to tell me," cried van Gulpendam in amazement, "that the
inspector has told you all that?"
