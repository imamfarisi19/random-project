No sooner had the creaking door given admittance to the woman than
he called out sharply to her:

"Where have you been all this time? Come, make haste, get me another
pipe."

The wretched creature obeyed without a murmur. She advanced to the
baleh baleh, took some tandjoe out of a small box, warmed it at the
flame of the palita, and then mixed it with a little very finely cut
tobacco. Then she rolled it in her fingers into a little ball about
the size of a large pea, put this into the bowl of the opium pipe,
and handed it to the wretched smoker.

During these operations, and when she leaned forward to hand him
the pipe, the miserable smoker, no longer master of his passions,
and wholly unable to restrain himself, had acted in a manner so
outrageously indecent, that Grashuis cried out:

"Oh, this is too revolting! Come, let us be off, I cannot stand it
any longer."

Just at that moment a cry was heard a little further down the
half-dark passage.

"Good God, this is most infamous! Is it possible--Let us get out--Let
us get out, friends--fire from Heaven will fall upon us and consume
us!"

It was van Beneden who had walked a few steps further down the passage,
and had been peering into one of the recesses down there. Now he
wildly rushed out of the place, dragging his friends almost by main
force along with him.

"What in the world is the matter with you?" asked Grenits.

"Oh, I can't tell you what I have seen," cried August van Beneden,
hardly able to speak plainly in his excitement. "Come along."

"Now no false modesty," said Grashuis; "we have come here on purpose
to gain what information we can about the horrors of opium, and so each
one of us must tell his experience. What was it you saw, Theodoor?"

"Don't ask me," cried Theodoor Grenits. "It is really too abominable;
such things must not be uttered--And the victim--was a little Javanese
girl--she struggled frightfully."

"Aye," said van Rheijn, "I thought I heard screaming."
