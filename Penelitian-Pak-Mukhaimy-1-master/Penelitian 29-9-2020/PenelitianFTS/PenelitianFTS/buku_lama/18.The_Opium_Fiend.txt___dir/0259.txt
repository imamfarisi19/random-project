"But, Resident," resumed Verstork, as soon as his chief paused for
a moment to take breath, "when we came running up to her cries for
help, she was naked, bleeding, her hair dishevelled. Everything in
fact pointed to--"

"A desperate resistance to the police," broke in van Gulpendam. "I
know all about that. Did you examine her?"

"No, I did not."

"Very well, that examination I have ordered the medical authorities
to hold, and see there," continued the Resident, as he looked out of
the window, "why, unless I am mistaken, that is the carriage of the
chief medical officer now stopping at the gate! We shall soon get to
the bottom of this business."

Almost immediately after this the chief constable came in to announce
the arrival of the Surgeon General. The latter advanced to the
Resident's chair, shook hands very ceremoniously, and then went through
the same process, but much more familiarly, with the Controller.

"Ha, Verstork--you here?" he said.

Before, however, the Controller had time to reply, the Resident,
turning to the doctor, said:

"Take a seat, doctor--well?--"

"No question of any such thing, Resident!"

"Indeed--now did I not tell you so? But the girl was wounded they
told me."

"A few scratches of no importance whatever--mere trifling skin-wounds
and a little blood!"

"There was therefore no stu--stu--what did you call it?"

"Stuprum violentum--Oh, no, no! nothing of the kind. Here is the
formal certificate properly filled in--that will be sufficient to
satisfy all objections."

"Thank you, doctor--much obliged to you."

"Now, Resident, I must beg you to excuse me. I must be off at once as
I have a number of visits to pay. Good-bye, sir--good-bye, Verstork."

"No excuse required, doctor," said van Gulpendam, "don't let me detain
you; good-morning!"

As soon as the medical officer had disappeared van Gulpendam turned
to Verstork and said:

"You heard that--didn't you, Mr. Verstork?"

"Oh, yes, I heard it; but my conviction is not the least shaken."
