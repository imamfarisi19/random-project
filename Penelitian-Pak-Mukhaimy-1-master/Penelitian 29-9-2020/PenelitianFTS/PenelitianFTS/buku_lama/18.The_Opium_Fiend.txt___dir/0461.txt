"'This precious document bore the Home Secretary's signature.

"'Here at Oleh-leh I had made attempts with the pills in question
to cure the Chinese opium smokers of their fatal passion, and my
efforts in their behalf had met with marked success. I had further
given a couple of hundred of them to the officers of the garrison
for distribution among such of their men as might need them. These
gentlemen also gave me the most glowing account of the success of
the medicine. The trophy of bedoedans in my study was enriched by
half-a-dozen pipes; and I must confess, Charles, that as often as my
eye happened to fall on those instruments of moral ruin, which are
hanging there harmless on my wall as the visible tokens of victories
obtained, I could not repress a feeling of self-satisfaction. Was I
now to desist? Was I forbidden any longer to attempt the rescue of
the infatuated wretches around me? I could not realise it--I could
not believe it. Surely the Government would not refuse to hold out a
helping hand to the myriads of wretched victims of opium which swarm
all about India! There must be a mistake somewhere. The Government
must have been misinformed and all that was needed was for somebody
to open its eyes to the truth.

"'To put these pills into the hands of the opium farmer for
distribution would be reducing the whole thing to the most utter
absurdity and to ensure failure beforehand.

"'I therefore sat down and drew up a carefully detailed statement
in which I gave the result of my own experience, the evidence of
the missionaries and the favourable opinions also of the officers
mentioned above. I added to my document legally attested declarations
of these gentlemen as to the salutary effects of the medicine.

"'Finally, I ventured to suggest, that, in favour of these pills as a
bona fide medicine, an exception might be made, and that, as prepared
and sent out by the Missionary Society, they might be excluded from
the regulations of the opium law.
