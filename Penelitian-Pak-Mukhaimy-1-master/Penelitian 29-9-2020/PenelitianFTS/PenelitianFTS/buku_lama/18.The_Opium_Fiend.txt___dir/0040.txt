As van Gulpendam made his appearance in the pandoppo he was greeted
with the words, somewhat sternly uttered: "What business has that
pajoeng here? You know I won't have the thing in this place." And
turning very sharply upon the unhappy attendant, Laurentia cried: "Back
with you, away, quick!" and a single look from the master caused the
man to disappear with his umbrella faster, indeed, than he had entered.

"I say," said Mrs. van Gulpendam, addressing her husband, "Dalima
has come back. I want you just to guess where that good-for-nothing
creature has been to."

"What is the use of my trying to guess?" replied the husband. "She
has no doubt dropped anchor somewhere in the dessa."

"In the dessa," scornfully exclaimed the lady, "oh, no doubt. Not a
bit of it--she has been on the tramp with that Ardjan of her's."

"Pardon, madam!" cried the poor girl, who understood Dutch quite well
enough not to lose a syllable of her mistress's words.

"And now," Laurentia went on, all in a breath, "now she has came home
with quite a romantic tale. She pretends that she has been carried off,
forsooth, by Lim Ho, and that she has passed the night in a ship. Just
fancy that."

At the name of Lim Ho, and at the mention of the word "ship," the
Resident pricked his ears. The captain of the Matamata, the guardship,
had sent in a report in which he had said that the Kiem Ping Hin had
been cruising about the coast. That schooner-brig belonged to the
opium farmer, who was shrewdly suspected of being in close league
with the opium smugglers. Hence the attention of the Resident was so
suddenly arrested.

"What ship?" asked van Gulpendam, somewhat hastily.

"How should I know what ship?" replied his wife. "You had better ask
that wretched girl."

"Pardon, madam!" cried Dalima, as she was still cowering in great
terror on the floor of the pandoppo.

"Come, Dalima," said van Gulpendam, with some kindness in his voice,
"come now, my girl, just tell us what has really happened to you."
