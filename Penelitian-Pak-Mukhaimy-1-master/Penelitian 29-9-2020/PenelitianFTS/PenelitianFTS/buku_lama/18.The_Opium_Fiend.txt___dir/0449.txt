Lim Yang Bing nodded assent. In his heart he was beginning to curse
his boasting and vapouring.

"Have you seen the Resident lately?" asked Laurentia carelessly,
but determined to strike while the iron was hot.

"No, njonja," replied the Chinaman politely, but with none of his
former gush.

"I know he wishes to speak to you about the contract--it runs out I
think with the current year?"

"Yes, njonja."

"And I think the monopoly for the next three years will be granted
some time this month?"

"Yes, njonja."

"Do you intend to bid for it, babah?"

"I think so, njonja."

"Yes, njonja! no, njonja! I think so, njonja!" cried Laurentia
mimicking the poor Chinaman most comically, "But, hush, someone
is listening--What do you say is the meaning of those words on the
lanterns, babah?"

The last question she asked in her ordinary tone of voice, with that
light-hearted giggle which was peculiar to the handsome woman.

"Those letters mean: 'We pray for happiness and prosperity.'"

"Thank you, and on that one yonder?"

"The word on that one signifies: 'Lantern of Heaven?'"

Thus talking they had walked away out of ear-shot.

"Now," resumed Laurentia in a subdued voice, "now we can go on with
our conversation:

"You seem to be very lukewarm about that monopoly business, babah. I
fear you will have a competitor at the auction."

"Who is he?" asked Lim Yang Bing somewhat eagerly.

"I have heard the name of Kwee Sioen Liem mentioned, the Solo man;
you know!"

"Indeed," muttered the Chinaman evidently much put out.

"Yes, they say he is a rich man, he may do you some damage perhaps,
babah," continued Mrs. van Gulpendam fixing her glittering eyes upon
her companion.

To this Lim Yang Bing made no reply, but he kept on with measured
step walking by the side of the Resident's wife.

"That bit of information does not seem to affect you very
much?" continued Laurentia with a slight sneer.

"Is that why the Resident wants to see me?" asked the Chinaman.
