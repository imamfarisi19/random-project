Not only was the actual expense of this habitual indulgence greater
than the means of many would allow; but the fatal habit engendered
other cravings which also had to be gratified, and which helped
to sweep away the little that opium had left. Moreover the love of
work--never under any circumstances too strong in a tropical land--was
first seriously impaired, then wholly extinguished, and, when not
under the influence of the opiate the smoker was a slovenly, drowsy,
lazy and objectless being, wholly unfit for the least exertion, whom
nothing could rouse into activity but fresh indulgence in the baneful
remedy. Indeed the sanitary condition of the people of Kaligaweh
had degenerated with such alarming rapidity, that the most casual
observer could not fail to be struck by the change. If, in days gone
by, a European visited the dessa--which it is true but very seldom
happened--he could not fail to admire the healthy and sturdy look of
its inhabitants; but now he constantly came upon men and women whose
ghastly appearance could not but excite in him the deepest pity. There
could be no mistake about it, at a single glance it was evident that
he had before him the victims of the terrible opium-fiend.

Those grey livid faces from which every trace of the Oriental
bronze tint had faded; that wrinkled skin which looked like
parchment overheated without being scorched; those wasted angular
features which gave to the head the appearance of an unsightly
skull; those deep sunken eyes with their jaded look and the dark
blue rings around them; those stooping forms and receding chests;
that extraordinary emaciation of the upper body, of which every rib
could be counted, and which conveyed an idea of transparency, for the
specimens which one met had hardly a rag about them; barely a bit of
dirty clothing wrapped round their loins to hide their nakedness;
that deep distressing cough which came, with hollow sound, from
the labouring breast and spoke of lungs wasted with disease whilst
it seemed to shake to pieces the entire frame; those spindle legs,
so poor, so meagre, that they seemed hardly able to totter along
under the weight of the body they had to support; all these formed
the stereotyped picture of defaced humanity and bore incontestable
witness to the protracted sufferings and unfathomable misery which
had reduced these poor blighted creatures to mere walking skeletons.
