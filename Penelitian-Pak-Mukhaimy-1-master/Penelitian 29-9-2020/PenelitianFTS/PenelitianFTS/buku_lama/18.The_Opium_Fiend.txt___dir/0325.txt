"But I clearly see what the toean Assistant Resident is aiming at. The
greater part of the present which I took the liberty of offering to
the njonja he keeps for himself, and to that he intends to add the
fine which Lim Ho will have to pay, should he be found guilty of
smuggling instead of Ardjan. It is not at all a bad idea, I admit;
but I leave it to the Kandjeng toean to say whether he thinks it
quite fair and honest."

Meidema sat there as if thunderstruck. A terrible suspicion began
to arise within him. Yes! his money matters were not by any means
in a healthy state. His housekeeping was an expensive one, all that,
he felt, was true enough. Could his wife under the hard pressure of
circumstances--could she have been induced to yield to the temptation,
might she possibly not have told him the whole truth? Might she
perhaps have mentioned to him only part of the bribe she had received,
just to see how he would take it? Yes! that must be it--His wife and
his daughters! Yes! now it flashed across him that they seemed much
confused when he came in. And then the line of conduct which he had
adopted before the Resident who, he felt, was no friend to him--with
an awful imprecation he sprang to his feet:

"Babah!" he exclaimed, "you are an impudent liar!"

"If the toean Assistant Resident becomes abusive," said Lim Yang
Bing with the same imperturbable calmness, "then I must request the
Kandjeng toean to give me leave to retire."

"Mr. Meidema," said van Gulpendam sternly, "I must beg of you to
moderate your language."

"How much do you say there was in that packet?" asked Meidema,
in despair.

"I offered the njonja Assistant Resident ten bank notes of a thousand,
and ten of five hundred guilders."

Poor Meidema fairly moaned with anguish and dismay.

"Is that true?" he asked again, with faltering tongue.

"I swear it!" was the quiet reply.

"Oh! I must go and get to the bottom of this!" cried the wretched man,
as he frantically rushed from the room.
