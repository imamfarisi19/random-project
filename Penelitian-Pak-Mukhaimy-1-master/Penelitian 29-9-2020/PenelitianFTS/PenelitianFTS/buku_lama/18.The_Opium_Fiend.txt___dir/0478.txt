"'But how grand, how magnificent, how sublime was the spectacle! The
towering waves which like a stately row of hills came moving along
the intense azure blue of the Indian Ocean--that graceful curve of the
billow as it neared the pumice reefs which lie at the base of the mass
of trachyte--then the thundering fall of this mighty crest toppling
over, as it were, into a sea of seething milk in which every drop,
every foam-speck glittered in the rays of the tropical sun--that
finely divided spray which hung over the watery mass and wrapped
it as in a veil of transparent silver-gauze--all this, my friends,
formed a spectacle which can never be effaced from my memory but
will dwell there engraven as on tables of stone. At times, when a
wave of unusual height came rolling in, the entrance of the caves
would be completely swallowed up and hidden and the water driven into
the interior would continue its perpetual work of excavation. Then,
for a few moments it seemed as if the holes had disappeared. But
presently, when the wave flowed back again, the water, impelled by the
tremendous force of the compressed air within, would rush forth like
a horizontal fountain five or six hundred feet in length, spouting
and hissing and blowing with a roar which was perfectly appalling,
and forming whirls and high-flowing eddies in the retreating wave.

"'No, no, no, I durst not touch that swinging ladder; but I have
nevertheless made up my mind to penetrate by some other means into the
interior of those mysterious cavities. The natives here tell me that
when the south-east trade-wind is far from the south-coast of Java,
on very calm days a flat-bottomed boat may enter the Goewah Temon,
which is the name of one of the grots. The loerah of the dessa Ajo
has promised me to keep a canoe in readiness for me, if I will give
him notice beforehand; and, on the first favourable opportunity I mean
to make the attempt. Meanwhile, however, I have had to satisfy myself
with a description of this birdsnesting which I soon hope to witness in
person, and this is what one of the chiefs has told me concerning it.
