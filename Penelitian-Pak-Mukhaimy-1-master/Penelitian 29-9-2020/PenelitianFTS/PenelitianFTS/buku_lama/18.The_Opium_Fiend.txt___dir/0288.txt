"Resident, I have come to inform you that the court has risen and
stands adjourned for a week."

"What? adjourned? After what my secretary told me? Have the members
refused to sit? Splendid fellows those natives!"

"No, no, Resident, by your leave--the chiefs did not refuse at all."

"Didn't they? Then how did it come about?"

"I will tell you, Resident. When Mr. Zuidhoorn was about to open the
proceedings and when he spoke the words: 'Usher, clear the court and
see that it be not further disturbed,' he found that the usher had
disappeared altogether."

"The usher disappeared?"

"Yes, Resident, he had got out of the way."

Van Gulpendam's face beamed with satisfaction.

"But," said he, "that would hardly put a stop to the proceedings?"

The secretary here interposed and said:

"As I was leaving the court I ordered the usher to write, from my
dictation, a paper summoning Mr. Zuidhoorn and all the members of
the court to clear out of the premises."

"Sharp practice that!" remarked van Gulpendam.

"Do you not approve of my conduct, Resident?"

"Of course, most certainly I do; but what took place next?"

"The poor devil of an usher was so utterly dumfoundered that he could
not hold a pen, and it was no use therefore to dictate anything to
him. I then gave him the message to deliver verbally."

"Yes--and then?" asked van Gulpendam.

"Then I came away to tell you."

"But I suppose," continued van Gulpendam--"you, Mr. Thomasz, will be
able to tell us what happened?"

"When the usher again entered the court," resumed the deputy-recorder,
"he stammered forth a few incoherent and utterly unintelligible words,
to which Mr. Zuidhoorn did not pay the slightest heed. He brought
his hammer down, declared the session open, and turned to the chief
djaksa to request him to read out the first charge."

"What case was it, Mr. Thomasz?" asked van Gulpendam with some
curiosity.

"Oh, it was some case of coffee-stealing, sir, some old woman--"
