Grenits had helped him to realise as profitably as possible the
proceeds of the sale, and when he reached Batavia he had sent a
considerable portion of the money to his mother, recommending her
to be very careful of it, as he might most probably be obliged, in
consequence of his removal from Banjoe Pahit, to diminish the amount
of his monthly remittances.

When the Tambora was nearly on the horizon there were still
handkerchiefs waving farewell to him from the shore-boat.

Verstork still kept on deck gazing at the shore. "Fine noble fellows,"
he muttered as he wiped away a tear.








CHAPTER XXIII.

THE COURT ADJOURNED.


On a certain day, not very long after the events narrated in the former
chapters, a carriage drew up before the pandoppo of the Regent's
house situated on the green of Santjoemeh, where the members of the
judicial bench of that district used to hold their court.

Out of the carriage there stepped a gentleman who looked with some
surprise at the concourse of people which had gathered around the
house; but who, nevertheless, with calm and dignified air, walked up
the steps which led to the interior.

That gentleman was Mr. Zuidhoorn, the president of the district-court,
who, on the day appointed, had come to open the session.

The crowd assembled in front of the Regent's pandoppo consisted
chiefly of Javanese, a circumstance which could not but attract the
notice of the judicial functionary, inasmuch as the native population,
which was formerly so fond of frequenting the courts held under the
Wariengien trees of the village green by its native chiefs, now shows
the greatest disinclination to enter the Dutch courts of justice.

As a rule, the Javanese is never seen there except he be fettered
or under the escort of a couple of policemen--that is to say, either
as a prisoner, as a criminal, or as a witness. Among the crowd some
Chinamen also were conspicuous, and all were evidently awaiting with
anxiety an event of no common interest.
