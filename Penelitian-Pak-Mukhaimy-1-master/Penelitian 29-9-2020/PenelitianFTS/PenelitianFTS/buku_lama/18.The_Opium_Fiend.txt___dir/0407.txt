"How can you touch it, my dear madam?"

"Touch it? why not?" scornfully replied Laurentia as she flung
back the kris rattling upon the table. "Why not touch it? the thing
doesn't bite."

"Of course not, my dear," said Henriette; "but the mere thought that
it has murdered a man!"

"Pooh! a Chinaman!" cried Laurentia.

"But a Chinaman is a human being," objected her friend.

"I suppose so," was Laurentia's disdainful reply.

"It is well that Lim Yang Bing or Lim Ho are not by to hear you,"
said Thomasz forcing a laugh.

"Oh that is a different matter altogether," said the arrogant woman.

"They are opium-farmers," cried Henriette.

"They are millionaires!" added her friend.

The two ladies uttered these exclamations almost simultaneously, with
an indescribable tone of sarcasm peculiar to their sex. Laurentia
fully understood the taunt and felt it too; but she gave no sign
of displeasure.

"Ah yes," continued Henriette following up her pleasant little
home-thrust. "Now you mention their names, what has become of the
two Chinamen. I don't see them. Yonder is the Chinese captain and Kam
Tjeng Bie the wealthy merchant; but I can't see the two opium-farmers."

"They will take good care," added the other lady, "not to show their
noses here."

"I daresay," carelessly remarked Laurentia, "that they find plenty
to do getting ready for the wedding."

"Is not the murderer," asked Henriette, "the father of baboe Dalima
who accused Lim Ho of--?"

"My dear Henriette," hastily interposed Mrs. van Gulpendam, "that
is the merest tattle--in our gossiping Santjoemeh you ought not to
believe one tenth part of what you hear."

"But," continued she rather hurriedly as if anxious to change the
subject, "but, Mr. Thomasz, what kind of gollokh is that yonder on the
table--that looks as if it were blood-stained too--did the murderer
use that thing also?"

"Oh no, madam," replied the assistant-clerk, "that is nothing but
chicken's blood."

"Chicken's blood?" inquired Henriette with a laugh.
