"Ah, I thought as much!" he cried, as he entered the pandoppo, and
then to the servants: "Look sharp, give the gentlemen glasses."

As this was going on, Laurentia slipped away unobserved leaving the
lords of the creation to enjoy themselves in their own fashion.

The Resident whispered a few words to Kwee Siong Liem, one of the
wealthiest Chinamen in Santjoemeh, and this latter, during the brief
conversation, strove to cast furtive glances at Lim Yang Bing.

"I shall go as high as I possibly can, kandjeng toean," said the babah;
"but I fear--"

"You need not be afraid," whispered van Gulpendam.

"Aye, but, kandjeng toean, the bidding will run up too high!"

"Don't forget, babah, that there are eight additional licenses
specified in the contract."

"That's all very well, kandjeng toean; but--"

However, the kandjeng toean did not stay to listen to the Chinaman's
objection. He stepped forward, took off his cocked hat, raised the
glass which a servant had put into his hand and said:

"Here's success to the sale!" The sentiment drew forth cheers from
the assembled Celestials on whom the generous wine of Veuve Clicquot
was beginning to have an exhilarating effect.

"To the health of the kandjeng toean!" cried the assistant resident
of police.

"To the health of the Chinese major!" shouted another and so it went
on. To all these toasts ample justice was done. The little slanting
eyes of the Celestials were really beginning to twinkle right merrily.

At length the clock struck eleven and the clear metallic sound rang
quivering through the apartment.

"Now, gentlemen!" cried the Resident, "to business! But first allow
me to inform those present here who may not happen to be successful in
this competition, that in a few days the monopoly for the district of
Bengawan will be put up to auction; and that, a couple of days after
that again, another valuable contract will be offered for sale. You
see, therefore, that there are rich, very rich profits awaiting many
of you."
