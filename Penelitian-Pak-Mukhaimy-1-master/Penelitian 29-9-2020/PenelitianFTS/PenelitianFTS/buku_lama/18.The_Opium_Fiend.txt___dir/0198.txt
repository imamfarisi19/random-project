"'I have not very much time to spare, sir,' were his first words of
welcome when he saw me enter the office in which he sat to receive me.

"'I have not very much time to spare, therefore I beg you will at
once get under weigh.'

"'Mr. van Gulpendam,' I began, 'yesterday I had some talk with Miss
Anna--and--'

"'Do pray set sail at once,' cried he, interrupting my opening speech,
'I tell you again I have no time for dawdling. I may at once tell you
that I do not think it a very proper thing for a gentleman to get a
young girl into a quiet corner. Fair and above board is my motto,
sir. An honest man sails straight into port. All that tacking and
trimming are not to my taste, I can tell you.'

"'My dear sir!' cried I, 'I have already told Mrs. van Gulpendam
that the excitement and the surroundings had quite thrown me off my
guard. It is now, and it always was, my intention to ask you fairly
and openly for your daughter's hand. There can, between us, be no
question of any intrigues or mysteries, and my presence here, Mr. van
Gulpendam, has no other motive than to declare to you my love to Miss
Anna, and to obtain your sanction to our union as man and wife.'

"'So, so,' said he, 'does the wind sit in that quarter? You have
pricked your chart very prettily indeed. Now would you like to know
what I have put down in my log, eh?'

"'Mr. van Gulpendam, I can assure you that I never was more serious in
my life--the question is to me one of the utmost importance,' said I,
amazed and disgusted at all this sea-jargon. 'In heaven's name let
us lay aside all jesting. I simply have the honour of asking you for
the hand of your daughter.'

"'Mr. van Nerekool,' he replied, 'I also am in a most serious
mood.' This he said in a somewhat nettled tone, however, not another
nautical expression passed his lips during the interview. 'How can
you suspect me of jesting, when I ask you whether you can surmise to
what decision I am about to come with regard to your question?'
