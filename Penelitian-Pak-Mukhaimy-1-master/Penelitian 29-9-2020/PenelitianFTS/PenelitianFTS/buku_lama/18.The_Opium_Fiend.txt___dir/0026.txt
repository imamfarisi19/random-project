CHAPTER III.

HOEKOEM KAMADOOG--THE VAN GULPENDAM FAMILY.


Nothing could be more strange, and indeed awful, than the contrast
between the fair face of nature and the hideous cruelty which man
was about to perpetrate on that little sequestered spot on the north
coast of Java.

The storm which had been raging furiously during the night had now
fallen to a fresh yet warm breeze. The leaves of the singular forest
of mangrove were softly rustling in the wind, and the waves, which
a few hours ago were madly dashing on the shore, now were quietly
running up the beach with pleasant and melodious murmurs. Indeed,
the prospect from the hut over the little bay of the Moeara Tjatjing,
enclosed by its two headlands, was picturesque in the extreme. Under
the bright beams of the early morning sun, the intense blue of the sea
was glittering with indescribable purity and brilliancy, the surface
of the ocean was still heaving, the waves still were following each
other as in pursuit, here and there a breaker might still be seen
topped by a snow-white cap of foam; but there was nothing angry in
the scene. The bosom of Amphitrite still heaved, but all fierce and
angry passions seemed to have died away. At some little distance from
the land the schooner Kiem Ping Hin was dancing on the water, rising
and falling gracefully, while the British ensign floated at the peak.

Just in front of the hut, in which took place the stormy scenes we
have described in the former chapters, and close by the small group
of "Saoe" trees we have mentioned, there stood a clump of "Niboeng"
palms. Straight and smooth as candles were their stems, and high up in
the air their feathery tops were waving to the breeze. On all sides,
excepting on that of the sea, the mangrove wood, with its maze of
tangled roots, surrounded the hut as with an impenetrable wall.

The bay to which Lim Ho and his attendants had dragged their unhappy
prisoners was thus perfectly lonely, closely screened from every
human eye.
