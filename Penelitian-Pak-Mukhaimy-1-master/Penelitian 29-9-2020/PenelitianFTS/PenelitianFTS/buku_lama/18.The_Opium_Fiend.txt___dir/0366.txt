Fortunately, however, at this moment Sidin came in, and his appearance
checked the young merchant's indignant flow of words, a thing which
his friends might not have found it easy to do. The Javanese servant
held two formidable looking letters in his hand, which he offered to
his master.

"By Jove," cried van Rheijn, "two official letters! I bet you that
it is the order to send you to jail."

Grenits made no reply, but quietly opened one of the letters.

"Only a very commonplace marriage announcement," said he when he
had glanced at the paper; and then, when he had looked at it again,
he cried out:

"I say, boys, here's fun! just listen to me:--'Mr. and Mrs. Lim Yang
Bing and Mr. and Mrs. Ngow Ming Than have the honour to announce the
approaching marriage of Mr. Lim Ho, son of the former, to Miss Ngow
Ming Nio daughter of the latter. The marriage ceremony will take place
on the third of September next, and a reception will subsequently
be held at the residence of Mr. Lim Yang Bing in the Gang Pinggir
at Santjoemeh.'"

"Piping hot," remarked Grenits, "poor Dalima's trial is scarcely over!"

"A Chinese wedding must be a curious affair," said van Rheijn. "You
are going eh?"

"You may go if you like," returned van Nerekool, "I have not the
slightest objection, if only you will allow me to stay at home. I
could not, for the life of me, hold out my hand to that scoundrel
Lim Ho, or offer him even the most formal congratulations."

"Come, come," said Grashuis. "There will no doubt be a great crowd,
and it will be easy enough to get out of that part of the ceremony
without being remarked at all; who is to notice it?"

"That's right!" laughed Grenits, "that's it 'des accommodements avec
le ciel!' But just let me see what this second document is about. Upon
my word, Edward, you would have won your bet. The day after to-morrow,
I have to surrender myself into the custody of the jailer to undergo
my sentence of ten consecutive days of imprisonment."
