It was Than Khan's turn next.

"I have won," he exclaimed. "You see I have seven black together. You
had but five."

"Very good," said Liem King. "I shall go."

"But mind," said the other, "not a word about Dalima!"

"You trust me," was the answer.

A strange scornful smile passed over Ardjan's features.

Than Khan sat down cross-legged in the doorway of the hut, placing
himself in such a manner that while he had a clear view of the bay
before him, he could at the same time watch every movement Ardjan
might attempt to make.

Not a single action on board the schooner escaped the Chinaman's
watchful eye.

He saw the smuggler lower her boat, he then saw five or six Chinese
get into her. The little craft, rowed by a Javanese crew, then put
off and got under weigh. It soon got into the seething breakers and
as Than Khan watched the tremendous exertions of the rowers, he could
not help admiring the cool steady way in which the helmsman kept her
head firmly to the waves.

"That must be Lim Ho himself," he muttered.

Ardjan shuddered at the mention of that name. "Lim Ho!" he exclaimed,
his voice betraying his terror.

"Yes," said Than Khan, "in a few minutes they will all be here."

Just then the boat was getting into the Moeara. He was right, the
light craft manned by eight stout rowers was flying through the water
and had got clear of the dangerous surf.

Once under the lee of the bow-nets and fairly in the bay, the boat
was in comparatively smooth water and darted into the mouth of the
Tjatjing.

Liem King stood at the landing place waiting to receive his countrymen
and he began at once to lead the way to the little watch-house.

The five Chinamen had no sooner stepped ashore than the Javanese crew
began to make all possible haste to unload the boat.

A number of small tins and barrels lay piled up in the bottom and
these they brought to land and most carefully stowed away, hiding
them in the sand under the bushes which grew hard by.
