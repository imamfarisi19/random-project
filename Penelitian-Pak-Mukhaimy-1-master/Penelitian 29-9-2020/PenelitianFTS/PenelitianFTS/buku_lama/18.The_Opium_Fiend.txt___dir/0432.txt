The view of that ocean still further enhanced the beauty of the grand
panorama which lay stretched out in front of the little hut. On a
fine calm day the deep-blue expanse of water extended far--endlessly
far--away to the horizon, glittering under the rays of the tropical
sun like a metallic mirror; while numerous fishing boats, with their
white but quaintly-shaped sails, hovered about the Moeara Djetis,

whiteness. This magnificent spectacle, a kind of prororoca on a small
scale, could be watched from the verandah in its minutest details.

opium-den, and reveal to them the horrors it conceals, if, by so doing,
he may reasonably hope to do something to cure a crying evil; but he
ought not, without sufficient reason, to invade the sacred rights of
privacy by throwing open to his readers a cottage wherein--
