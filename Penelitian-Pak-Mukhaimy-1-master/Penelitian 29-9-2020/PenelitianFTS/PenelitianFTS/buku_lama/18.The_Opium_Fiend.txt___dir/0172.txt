But the young people did not feel the slightest inclination to
turn in, they were as yet too much excited by the events they had
just witnessed to think of going to sleep. So they brought out the
chairs upon the aloon aloon in front of the passangrahan, and having
seated themselves in a circle they made themselves as comfortable as
circumstances would allow and lit their manillas. There was, of course,
no question of getting anything to drink in the shape of wine or beer,
still less possibility was there of obtaining a glass of grog. Unless
there are Europeans settled in a dessa, such liquors are nowhere to be
found. But the Loerah had supplied for the refreshment of his guests
an ample quantity of cocoa-nut milk, and that drink was pronounced
most excellent. Indeed it is a most delicious and very refreshing
beverage when it is obtained from a young nut before the flesh has
had time to set and harden inside the rind.

Very soon the little circle of friends was comfortably seated under a
gigantic Wariengien tree, the tall branches of which spreading out far
and wide on all sides formed a canopy which covered nearly the entire
space of the aloon aloon, and offered a most grateful shade by day,
and a shelter also against the heavy dews of night.

From the majority of the horizontal branches there grew down a number
of shoots, some as thick as a man's finger, others no thicker than a
pipestem, others again as fine as whip-cord. These shoots, as soon
as they reached the soil, struck root and then rapidly increasing
in girth, formed, as it were, a number of pillars which helped the
old giant to bear his dense mass of wood and of foliage, and greatly
enhanced the beauty of the venerable tree.

The firmament above was of the deepest blue, and wonderfully pure
and clear. In that vault of Heaven innumerable stars glittered and
twinkled in spite of the moon which, now about her full, was shedding
over the peaceful scene her soft and placid radiance.
