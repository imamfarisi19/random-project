"Mr. Meidema," he said at length, "have you, as you were bound to do,
employed an expert to ascertain the quantity, the quality, and the
particular kind of opium that was found?"

"Yes, Resident, I have done so."

"Have you secured the surf-boat itself?"

"Yes, Resident," replied Meidema, "I did so; but, owing to some strange
neglect for which I am unable to account, the watchman at the town
jail, who had charge of the boat and with whom I had deposited it
for safety, had broken up the boat and used the timber for firewood."

A smile flitted over van Gulpendam's features, as he muttered,
inaudibly: "I have found the leak, I can caulk it," and then, aloud,
he said: "That's a thousand pities--to whose negligence do you ascribe
that?--But, never mind, we can look into that some other time. Now,
Mr. Meidema, will you allow me to give you a piece of good advice?"

"Oh, Resident, you know, I am always most happy to receive good
advice," was the reply.

"Your finances," continued van Gulpendam, "are not in the most
flourishing condition, I think. Eh?"

"Resident!"

"You have a large family--and your expenses must be considerable. Well
then, my advice to you is this: Try and arrange matters quietly with
the opium farmer."

"What do you mean, Resident?" cried Meidema, in utter amazement.

"You are shrewd enough, Mr. Meidema, to understand my drift. Lim
Yang Bing is a wealthy man, and a kind, indulgent father. His son,
you know, is on the eve of making an excellent match. He won't be so
very particular just now as to what he pays."

"Resident!"

"And then," continued van Gulpendam, "another piece of advice let me
give you. Very luckily for you the court, which was to have sat to-day
and given judgment on that opium-case, has been adjourned. You see,
you have yet time to alter that report of yours; which, I must say,
appears to me to be drawn up with too much partiality."

"That I will never do!" cried Meidema, vehemently interrupting
his chief.
