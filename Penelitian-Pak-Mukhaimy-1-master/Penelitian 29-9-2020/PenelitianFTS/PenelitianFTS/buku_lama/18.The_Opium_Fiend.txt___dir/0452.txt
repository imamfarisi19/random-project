"Hush! Hush!" was the cry on all sides.

Resident van Gulpendam glared round indignantly, and Laurentia looked
black as thunder at the interruption in the midst of the drinking
ceremony.

Van Rheijn would have crept underground to avoid those terrible eyes.

When the couple had thus copiously pledged one another, the bridegroom
took the left hand of the bride. He raised it to the level of her
breast, and in that attitude, the pair gravely saluted one another.

"I say," whispered Grenits, "I wish that dear little pet would give
me such a bow."

"I daresay," remarked August van Beneden; "a dear little pet with
two millions of money."

"Hush, hush!" was again the cry.

"Pooh!" cried Grenits, "millions squeezed out of the opium trade!"

The young lawyer hung his head in confusion.

"You are right," said he. "No! from such a source I would not take
a single farthing!"

"Hush, hush!"

Van Gulpendam's eyes flashed with indignation. The next rite was a very
curious one indeed. Two dishes were placed before the betrothed. They
contained a mixture of red and white pellets, the size of an ordinary
pea.

Grenits turned to one of the Chinamen who stood close beside him in
the crowd, and asked what might be the meaning of this ceremony.

"Are they medicine?" he asked.

"Yes, sir," replied the Chinaman. "The red balls represent the Jang
or male, the white represent the Jin or female principle in nature."

"Hush, hush!" resounded again on all sides. Lim Ho and the bride now,
each in a golden spoon, took up a red and a white ball, swallowed
them and once again bowed deeply to one another. Then the dishes
were interchanged, just as the cups had been before, the ceremony was
repeated and with that act, the marriage was complete. They were now
man and wife inseparably joined together.

Ngow Ming Nio and Lim Ho, the one set of millions was joined to
the other.

During all these festive rites, did Lim Ho bestow even one passing
thought upon his victim, baboe Dalima? We doubt it.
