This money had, in fact, for some time been constantly present to her
mind, and had been the cause of some hesitation before she finally
could make up her mind to undertake her long journey. She had anxiously
hoarded it to meet the expenses which she knew must soon come upon
her. The money was dear to her, for she would not be a burden upon
her poor mother, who, now that her father was a prisoner, had already
trouble enough to feed her little brothers and sisters. This money she
had clung to, for young as she was, she knew that a time of need would
soon be at hand. But all these considerations vanished as she thought
of her Nana--then she wavered no longer. Her own unhappy condition,
indeed, gave her but little uneasiness. She knew how kind-hearted
her country-women are, and she felt sure that in the hour of need,
she would find some hospitable roof to shelter her; and that even the
very poorest would reach her a helping hand, and would gladly share
her modest ration of rice with a traveller in distress.

Once, at Kaligaweh, Dalima had received a visit from M`Bok Kârijâh,
the loathsome confidante of Mrs. van Gulpendam. Perhaps it was at that
lady's suggestion that the old hag went to see her. She had whispered
to her something about a medicine made from the Clitoria Ternatea. At
first poor Dalima had not understood what she meant and had opened
her eyes wide with surprise--she knew nothing, of course, of the
connection between the filthy old hag and the Resident's lady. But
when the crone pretended to sympathise with her in her misfortune; and
proceeded to speak out more plainly--then the girl's indignation and
disgust knew no bounds, and she drove the old hag from her presence,
threatening to rouse the entire dessa against her should she venture
to show her face again. Her nature revolted at the foul crime which
M`Bok dared to suggest, such practices she was quite content to leave
to the more highly favoured daughters of civilisation.
