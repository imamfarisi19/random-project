Now, all that happiness was gone! The fatigue, the exertion which she
had undergone, and all the anxieties of the terrible events through
which she had passed; the dreadful suspense at the Goewah Temon in
which she had so nearly lost her darling Nana, had proved too much
for her.

Yes, she had been very very sad; but time heals even the deepest
wounds. And then, after all, she was with her Nana and she intended
to remain with her to her latest breath. She had travelled with Anna
to Batavia, and there she settled down to be the baboe of the little
van Nerekools who, she fervently hoped, would bless the union of
her friends.

And anyone who knows the faithful affection with which the Javanese
do attach themselves to their masters, if the latter will but treat
them with anything like fairness and kindness, must feel certain that
baboe Dalima will remain faithful to her trust until


THE END.
