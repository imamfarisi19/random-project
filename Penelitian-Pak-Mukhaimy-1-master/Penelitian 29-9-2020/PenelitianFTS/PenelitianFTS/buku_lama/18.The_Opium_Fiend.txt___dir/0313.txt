"I told the babah so, njonja," said the man.

"Well?"

"He wishes to speak to the njonja."

Mrs. Meidema made a gesture of impatience. But Lim Yang Bing,
the wealthiest Chinaman in the residence of Santjoemeh--perhaps the
richest man in all Dutch India--was not the kind of man who could very
well be turned away. It was, moreover, no very unusual thing for him
to come and pay his respects to the ladies and, on such occasions,
he generally had some pretty little nick-nacks to show.

"Very well, show him in," said Mrs. Meidema.

The needle-work had in all haste to be put away and concealed, and
some light fancy work had to be snatched up; for it would never do
to let that Chinaman see a European family employed in such drudgery.

"Tabeh njonja, tabeh nonna nonna. Saja halap--"

But we will not attempt to reproduce the Chinaman's execrable
Malay. In fact it would hardly be possible to do so, as the men of
his nationality find the greatest difficulty to pronounce some of the
consonants, and their talk is often extremely difficult to understand.

"Good-morning, madam; good-morning, young ladies," said he most
courteously, "I hope I am not intruding. I thought I might have found
the Assistant Resident at home; but since I am not so fortunate, I
take the liberty of paying my respects to the ladies--in the first
place to inquire after their health, and also to tell them a great
piece of news."

"News?" asked Mrs. Meidema, who like most women did not lack
curiosity. "Pray be seated, babah."

And, turning to the native servant who was sitting cross-legged on
the steps of the gallery, she said:

"Todrono, bring a chair."

As the Chinaman took his seat, the two girls looked at him with
wonder-waiting eyes.

"And now, babah, for your important news!" said Mrs. Meidema, somewhat
eager to hear it.

"First," said Lim Yang Bing with another bow, "allow me to inquire
after the state of the ladies' health."

"Oh, thank you," replied Mrs. Meidema, "we are all perfectly well."
