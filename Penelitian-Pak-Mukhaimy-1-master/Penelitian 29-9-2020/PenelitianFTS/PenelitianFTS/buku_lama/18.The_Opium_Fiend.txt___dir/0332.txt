"No, no," continued van Gulpendam, "I can see no alternative. Either
you are guilty or your wife is guilty, perhaps both are equally
culpable. You have, however, still time to make a choice; it is not
yet too late, but that choice must be made quickly, now, at once;
for I have made up my mind to telegraph to headquarters this very day."

To telegraph! Poor Meidema only heard the one dreadful word
"telegraph." He knew well what that word implied; he knew well in what
an arbitrary and off-hand way the fate of subordinates is decided at
Batavia. Already he saw himself dismissed and disgraced, shunned as a
social leper by every respectable man; his wife and children wandering
about in poverty, exposed to hunger and untold misery. Just then, as if
he had been able to read the unhappy man's thoughts, the Resident said:
"Come, Mr. Meidema, decide, make up your mind, there must be no delay."

"What must I do, Resident?" moaned the poor man, now fairly at his
wits' end.

"What must you do? It is clear enough what you have to do. There
is your report; it has just been handed to me along with the other
papers relating to the business of the Court at which on Tuesday next
I intend to preside. Take it; here it is; do with it what you will."

He thrust the document into Meidema's hand--who took it, gazed at it
for a moment with meaningless stare, then made some gesture with his
hands as though he would tear it up; but--before he could accomplish
the fatal deed, his brain seemed to whirl and he fell heavily to
the ground.

A doctor was sent for at once. When he made his appearance, he found
Meidema lying back in a chair surrounded by the entire household of
the Residence, but utterly unconscious; and all around the floor was
strewed with fragments of paper.

The physician spoke of brain fever, and he ordered the patient to be
removed to the hospital.

"There is no danger, I hope, doctor?" asked the Resident, in tones
of the deepest sympathy.
