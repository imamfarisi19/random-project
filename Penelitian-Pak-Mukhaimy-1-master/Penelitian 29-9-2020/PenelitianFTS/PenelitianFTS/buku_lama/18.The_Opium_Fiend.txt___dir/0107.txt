William Verstork could not help smiling at this communication.

"Pray don't laugh," cried Charles gravely, "although I cannot help
confessing that very strange thoughts forced themselves upon me
also. It was so strange, was it not? So wholly contrary to the
usages of society that a young girl should write such a letter at
such a time. At the time I could only look upon it as an Ã©tourderie,
a thoughtless action; but I am glad to tell you I soon found out my
mistake. The dear girl saw me appear at her father's house without
showing the slightest symptom of confusion, and soon convinced me
that she had excellent reasons for her seemingly strange conduct. As
it was not at all an unusual thing for me to accompany her, it could
not awaken any one's suspicion, that we took our places at the piano
in the brilliantly lighted inner gallery. Then I learnt why Anna had
thus strangely summoned me. She wished to invoke my assistance for
a certain Javanese, who is the lover and is to be the future husband
of her baboe; and who now lies under a charge of opium-smuggling."

Thereupon van Nerekool told his friends all he had heard from Anna,
about Ardjan's ill-treatment, and about the opium discovered at the
Moeara Tjatjing.

When he had finished speaking, William Verstork again said feelingly:
"It is very sad!"

"Yes, it is very sad," rejoined Charles, totally misunderstanding the
meaning of his friend's words. "But I hope the Javanese will not be
found guilty."

"And," asked Verstork deliberately, "And--your affection for this
girl is, you say, very strong?"

"Well," resumed van Nerekool, "since that evening I have, as Edward
has told you, had frequent opportunities of meeting my dear Anna,
sometimes at the Zuidhoorns', sometimes at the Commandant's, and
sometimes at her parents' house; and I have had frequent conversations
with her on the subject of this unfortunate police-case. And every
time I have seen her I have received stronger and stronger proofs--"
