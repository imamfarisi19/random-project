"'I hope,' cried I, 'that your decision will not be unfavourable to
me! Oh, sir, I love Miss Anna with all my heart and with all my soul!'

"'Of course, of course,' said he, 'these are the regular stock phrases
of all lovers. Now, are you really and seriously in love with her?'

"'How can you ask such a question?' cried I, vehemently.

"'Well,' replied van Gulpendam, 'I have my reasons,--and they are
very good reasons too--for doing so. You had an interview yesterday
evening with my wife, had you not?'

"'Yes, Resident,' was my reply.

"'And the conversation you then held with her opened up to you the
prospect of a future career. I think I am right there?' was his
second question.

"I simply sat staring at the man in utter amazement. Never, never,
could it have come into my head that he and his wife were of the same
way of thinking in such a matter as that."

"Why not, pray?" asked Verstork, very quietly.

"Why, my dear friend, I looked upon the Resident as worldly and
frivolous indeed; but I thought he was an honourable man, and one
who kept himself altogether clear of the intrigues in which his wife
appears to dabble."

Again the bitter smile curved Verstork's lips; but in the deep shadow
of the the Wariengien tree, van Nerekool failed to perceive it.

"Go on," said Verstork, who, though deeply moved, spoke in so perfectly
quiet and composed a tone of voice, that his friend did not notice
his feelings.

"To his last question," resumed van Nerekool, "I replied, 'Yes,
Resident, you are right. Mrs. van Gulpendam did make me certain
proposals.'

"'She spoke to you then of your future prospects, as well as on the
subject of your present request?' asked the Resident.

"'Yes, Resident,' was my reply,--indeed I was growing very nervous.

"'Well, then,' resumed he, 'you see that you have the making of your
career entirely in your own hands; and I do hope that you will now
at length prove yourself a man of some practical common sense.'
