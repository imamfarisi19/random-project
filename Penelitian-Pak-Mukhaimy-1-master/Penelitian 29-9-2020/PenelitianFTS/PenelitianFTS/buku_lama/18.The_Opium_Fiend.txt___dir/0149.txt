"Yes," said Laurentia slowly after a moment's pause, "you are the
only one who can arrange this matter. And, pray remember, that this
is a question upon which depends van Nerekool's future career--and
your own marriage."

And then, the proud ambitious woman told her daughter that she was
bent upon obtaining for her husband the order of the Netherland's
Lion; that this distinction, however, would not be got unless the
returns of the opium trade at Santjoemeh improved considerably--that
in fact the Virtus nobilitat was to be the price for the increase in
the revenue of Holland.

"But," continued Laurentia, "in order to make that increase possible,
Lim Yang Bing must continue to hold the opium monopoly--and that
he must cease to do if his son Lim Ho be found guilty of smuggling
and of outrage upon the natives. Therefore we are under the cruel
necessity--!"

As her mother began to speak Anna listened attentively; as she
continued, the girl sat with her eyes fixed on her mother's lips as
though she would read the words before she uttered them; at these
last words, she flew up wild and furious and passionately broke in
upon Laurentia's speech: "Ardjan is to be sacrificed, that my father
may get the Netherland's Lion--that never--no, mother, do you hear me,
that cannot--that shall not be!"

"But, Anna!" exclaimed Laurentia much alarmed at her daughter's
violence, "pray do not excite yourself so!"

"And did you make that proposal to Charles?--Yes? Oh, then I am
wretched indeed!"

"But, Anna--" Laurentia began to say.

"Now I understand his 'never,'" said the girl bitterly. "No, he
is right, never, never shall he marry the daughter of such parents
as mine!"

At these words she dashed out of the pandoppo and locked herself in
her own room.








CHAPTER XIII.

A RIDE TO BANJOE PAHIT. AMOKH!


"Now are you ready to start?"

With this question, Edward van Rheijn came rushing into van Nerekool's
room on Saturday afternoon.
