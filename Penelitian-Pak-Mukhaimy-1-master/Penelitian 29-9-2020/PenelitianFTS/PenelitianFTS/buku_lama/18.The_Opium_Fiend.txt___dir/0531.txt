Anna did not venture to look down into the sheer depth below her, where
the waters were boiling in their fury. She feared that a look into that
giddy depth might shake her resolution should she actually be compelled
to attempt the descent. She gazed out far away to the horizon. There,
almost due west, she could clearly see Noesa Kembangan, that beautiful
hilly island which, with its luxurious vegetation, seemed to float as

rhythmical swell and thunder of the ocean, which was giving forth its
mighty melody at her feet, she fancied she could hear again the soft
duet played by the cornet and the piccolo:
