"'So utterly lost was I in rapture that the rarest specimens
in butterflies fluttered past my very nose without my so much
as holding out my net. I gave the whole thing up in despair, and
tossed all my apparatus into a corner. But, what to do with oneself
at Gombong? The officers of the garrison were busy enough; but I
had nothing--absolutely nothing--to occupy my time. The climate of
Gombong is a wretched one--most miserably healthy, no chance of ever
getting a patient here! Being a devout Catholic, I sent up a little
prayer every now and then for a good epidemic, or at least some case
worthy of keeping one's interest going--nothing of the kind!'"

"Well now," cried Theodoor, "did you ever hear of such a fellow,
praying for an epidemic! Such a chap as that ought to be put out

at Buitenzorg!"

"Nonsense!" retorted van Rheijn, "does not every one pray for his
daily bread? Does not our friend van Beneden here pray for a good
lawsuit--and that is, perhaps, not much less serious a matter than
an epidemic. But let me go on.

"'Seeing that my prayers were not heard, I sought refuge in
poetry;--perhaps I might say I prayed and wrote verses alternately. I

in hexameters, in odes, in lyrics, in sonnets, in stanzas, in German,
in Polish--'"

"That must have sounded well!" interrupted Grashuis.

"'--In Polish, in French, nay, even in Latin!'"

"In Latin!" exclaimed Grenits, with a shout of laughter, "the fellow
must have gone raving mad!"

"Just fancy the poor child receiving an ode from her adorer entitled
'Solis occasus,'--and 'Virgini Agathæ pulcherrimæ Bemmelensi
dedicatus'--I should like to have seen her little phiz," cried van
Beneden.

"Do stop all that nonsense," remonstrated van Rheijn, who nevertheless
was laughing as heartily as the others, and when silence had been
restored, he continued:
