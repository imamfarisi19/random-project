"That is just it," rejoined Anna; "it is that very solitude that I
am most frightened at. You might come across a tiger or a wild boar."

"Why, Nana! there are no tigers anywhere in the neighbourhood; if
there were we must have heard of them, and as for boars, I am not
the least bit afraid of them, they always run away if they possibly
can. Do pray, dearest Nana, get me leave to go. I promise you that
by to-morrow night I shall be back again."

"I don't at all like the idea of it, Dalima. What will mamma say?"

"Oh, Nana dear," cried the baboe, in despair, "do pray go and try--do
pray go and ask madam!"

"She is quite sure to refuse," said Anna.

"Why should she?" persisted the girl.

"She will be just as much afraid as I am that in the darkness of the
night some accident may happen to you. How can you possibly dare to
undertake such a journey, Dalima?"

"My father is dying--he wants to see me!" cried Dalima. "That is
quite enough to give me courage for anything, Miss Anna. I would go
to Kaligaweh even if I knew that the road was full of ghosts--yes, if
there were a ghost behind every tree! Yet, I am much more frightened
of ghosts than of beasts or of men. Nana, I beg and pray--do go and
ask your mother!"

"Well," said the tender-hearted young girl, "I will go and try;
but mind you, I know it will not be of the slightest use."

"Thank you, Nana, thank you."

Thereupon Miss Anna rose from the divan upon which she had taken
a seat after she had admitted Dalima. She thrust her dainty little
feet into a pair of slippers she had carelessly thrown off. The young
girl was already partially undressed, and had been reclining in only
her sarong and kabaai; but she very soon threw about her a richly
embroidered morning gown, with a few turns of her dexterous hand she
twisted the rich mass of her loose-hanging hair into a knot, and ran
to the front-gallery in which her parents and the other card-players
were still engaged in their game.
