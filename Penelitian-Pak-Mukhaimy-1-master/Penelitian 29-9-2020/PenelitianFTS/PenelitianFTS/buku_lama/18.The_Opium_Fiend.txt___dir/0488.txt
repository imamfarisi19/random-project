"'My friends, I am utterly unable to describe to you the lovely scene
I was just then gazing upon. No pen is eloquent enough for that. It
would need the brush of some great artist to catch the glow and colour
of that entrancing view.

"'Quite unconscious that, in that lonely pool far away from any human
dwelling, and in the recesses of such a wilderness, any indiscreet eye
was watching them--the two girls, like real water nymphs, were gaily
disporting themselves. They pursued one another, trying to duck each
other in the stream, while they had the greatest trouble to prevent
their sarongs from getting loose and falling down. That game lasted
