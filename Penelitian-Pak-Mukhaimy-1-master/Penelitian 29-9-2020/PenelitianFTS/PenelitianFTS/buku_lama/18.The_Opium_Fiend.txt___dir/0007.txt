"The 'djoekoeng,'" muttered Than Khan.

Directed by the moaning sound they groped along the boat which was
but a hollowed tree. Its bamboo sail-wings were lying close by smashed
all to pieces by the wind and water; and a few steps further on they
discovered two human beings lying prostrate in the rank grass.

"Who is there?" called Liem King as he cautiously drew nearer.

"It is I," replied a very feeble voice in answer to the challenge.

"I? who is I?" asked the Chinaman.

"I, Ardjan," was the answer.

"What?" cried Liem King, "Ardjan of the Kiem Ping Hin."

A faint cry at these words issued from the lips of one of the
castaways.

"Silence," whispered the other Chinaman.

Both then bent forward over the figure which had given the name of
Ardjan; but in that thick darkness it was impossible to distinguish
anything.

One of them pulled a dark lantern out of his pocket, struck a match
and, with some trouble, managed to procure a light. As soon as he
had recognised the features he cried out:

"By ----! it is Ardjan! What in the world are you doing here?"

"I have fallen overboard," was the reply.

"Indeed you have? with that 'djoekoeng?'" sneered Liem King.

"I found her in the water as I was swimming about," was the reply.

"And that woman?" continued Liem King; "how about her? Did you pick
her up also floating about? Who is she?"

"She is Moenah, my sister," faintly said Ardjan.

"Ah! your sister," exclaimed Than Khan with a low, dirty laugh. "I
daresay she also managed to tumble overboard?"

With these words he threw the light of the lantern full on the face
of the so-called sister. The uncertain gleam revealed the well-shaped
form of a beautiful Javanese maiden of sixteen who, in her confusion,
strove to conceal her face under a veil, which, like all the rest of
her clothing, was dripping wet.

"Hallo!" cried Than Khan as he roughly tore the veil from the girl's
face, "what have we here? Dalima! the little 'baboe' of His Excellency
the Resident."
