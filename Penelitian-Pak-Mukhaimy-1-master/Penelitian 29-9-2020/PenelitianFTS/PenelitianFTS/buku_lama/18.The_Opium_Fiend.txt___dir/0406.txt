"Now then," said Laurentia in an undertone, "you may speak out. Who
pays that lawyer?"

"A company, madam," was the reply.

"A company! What? of Chinamen?" cried Laurentia impatiently.

"I did not say so, madam," replied the deputy clerk with a smile and
a slight bow.

"What company then?"

"Of Europeans, madam."

"Oh ho! you know them. You need not deny it; I see it in your face."

"Hush, madam," whispered Thomasz, "there are a couple of ladies coming
near," and then aloud he added: "Yes this is the very kris with which
the deed was done--you see the wavy blade is stained with blood--that
black spot--"

Mrs. van Gulpendam seized the weapon.

"Give me their names," she whispered as she stooped forward over the
table to take it up.

"I know but one of them--van Nerekool."

"Van Nerekool--still that van Nerekool," hissed the fair woman between
her clenched teeth. And then, turning to the pandoppo, she said to
one of the ladies who had by this time mounted the platform:

"Look here, Henriette, just look here--this is the kris with which
the murder was committed." The policeman in charge of the table
seemed inclined to step forward to forbid the others to approach;
but a haughty look from Laurentia restrained him.

"Is that really the kris?" asked Henriette.

"Yes," exclaimed Laurentia, "look, you! that's how it was done--slash
across the throat!" She accompanied these words with a sweep of the
formidable weapon which made both the ladies start back in terror.

"A magnificent woman that Laurentia!" said a young man in the body
of the hall. "Just look at her attitude, look at her features, look
at that hand as she grasps the dagger! What a lady Macbeth! what a
perfect instep!"

"Aye, aye," quoth another, "she is posing, she knows--she feels--that
we are admiring her."

"What are you frightened at?" continued Mrs. van Gulpendam, "see here,
that spot is the blood of the victim, is it not, Mr. Thomasz?"

"Disgusting!" cried both ladies in a breath.
