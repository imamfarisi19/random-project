A short time before his adventure at the Moeara Tjatjing Ardjan had
procured for his father a few katties of opium. So long as the supply
lasted, the old man had not troubled himself in the least about the
treatment his son had undergone; but when he saw that the supply was
beginning to run low, then he began to look with apprehension to the
future, and especially alarmed was he when he heard that Ardjan had
exchanged the hospital for the jail. His poor muddled brain fancied
that he might hasten Ardjan's release by making a charge against Lim
Ho; and he had been further encouraged to take the step by the advice
of a pettifogging lawyer, who thought that, in an action against the
rich son of the still more wealthy opium-farmer, he had discovered a
very pretty little vein of gold. Thus the charge was, in the proper
form, laid before the Court at Santjoemeh and a prosecution against
Lim Ho was ordered accordingly.

This matter the president of the Council had put into the hands of his
young colleague, van Nerekool, and he, most anxious that justice should
be done and that the miscreant should pay the legal penalty for his
offence; and glad also, thus to be able to perform the promise which he
had made to Anna, the fair daughter of the Resident, that he would do
his best to save Dalima's lover, had readily undertaken the case, and
was confident that he would be able to bring it to a successful issue.

But, on a certain afternoon, while the sun was yet high in the
heavens, Pak Ardjan had gone to have a look at his store of opium
which he had secreted by burying it deep in the ground, and heaping
over the place a heavy layer of stones. Much to his regret he found,
upon opening his store, that, at the most, he had but a couple of taÃ«l
left. These he proceeded to carry home with him; for he had promised
some opium-smoking friends to let them have a supply that evening,
and, as they were good customers and paid him handsomely, he would
not disappoint them.
