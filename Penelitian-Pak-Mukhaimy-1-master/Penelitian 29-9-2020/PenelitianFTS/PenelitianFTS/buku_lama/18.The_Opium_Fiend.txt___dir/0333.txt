"My dear sir," replied the medical man, "there is the very gravest
danger. It is a very sad case, it will surprise me much if the man
does not go mad--that is if he gets over this attack at all."

The Resident thereupon at once drove off to break the fatal news as
gently as possible to Mrs. Meidema.

The evening papers contained the following paragraph:

"We are grieved to state that Assistant Resident of Police,
W. D. Meidema, was this morning suddenly taken seriously ill. It seemed
at first as if he were suffering from some acute form of brain fever;
but after careful examination, our zealous and able medical officer has
come to the conclusion that it is a case of 'melancholia attonita.' It
is his opinion that no relief can be hoped for unless the patient
be at once removed to Europe. There he will probably have to pass a
considerable time in some asylum in which he can have the care which
his peculiar malady requires. If we are rightly informed, our Resident
at once telegraphed to Batavia; so that it is probable there will be no
delay in obtaining the necessary leave of absence. Mr. van Gulpendam
has further exerted himself to the utmost in obtaining a passage to
Europe for the sorrow-stricken family in the Noah III. which is to
sail for Patria on the day after to-morrow. Mrs. van Gulpendam also is
untiring in her attention, and entirely devotes herself to assist the
afflicted family by word and deed. Both the Resident and his wife have
once again shown how cordial is their sympathy with their subordinates,
and how thoroughly they have their welfare at heart. Our best wishes
accompany Mrs. Meidema and her children, and we heartily pray that
the Assistant Resident may speedily be restored to health."

The correspondent had been well informed. This much is certain, that
on the 14th of July the ship Noah III. left her anchorage, and under
the influence of the Eastern monsoon, left the harbour of Santjoemeh
and was quickly out of sight.
