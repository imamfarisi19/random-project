"I have no doubt," Liem King again ventured to say, "that some
crocodile has carried her off."

"Or maybe," said Than Khan, "a tiger has got hold of her."

Lim Ho applied a small whistle to his lips. He blew a shrill piercing
note, and at the summons one of the Javanese crew at once presented
himself at the door of the hut.

"Call your mates," ordered Lim Ho. In an instant the whole boat's
crew was present.

"Tie me up those scoundrels," cried Lim Ho, "make them fast," he said,
as he pointed to Liem King and Than Khan. "Tie them up, and securely
too, do you hear me!"

The men readily obeyed, it was the work of an instant. Nothing in
this world gave these fellows greater delight than to be allowed
to lay their hands upon a Chinaman. They set to work as roughly,
as brutally as they could. The knots were tied and they hauled upon
the ropes with a will. The wretched victims groaned with the pain.

Oh! if ever it should come to an outbreak, then woe to the Celestials
in Java, they would find but little mercy. Who knows--were such
a catastrophe to take place they might not be the only race to
suffer. There are others who might get into trouble too!

When both the Chinese spies were firmly secured, Lim Ho called to
his men.

"Now, my lads, now for a hunt! A girl--little Dalima--has escaped from
us and we must get her back. Five hundred 'ringgiets' six dollars to
the man who finds her and brings her in!"

With a ringing cheer the boat's crew dashed from the hut.

When they had left, Lim Ho ordered one of his followers to hand him
his pipe. He filled the small bowl with the slender bamboo stem with
extremely fine-cut tobacco, then he lit the pipe and began to blow the
smoke from his nostrils. Thereupon he took a seat on the only chair the
hut contained. It was a rough and clumsy piece of furniture, cut out of
the wood with a clasp-knife. The other Chinamen sat down cross-legged
on the floor, while their captain once again turned to Ardjan.
