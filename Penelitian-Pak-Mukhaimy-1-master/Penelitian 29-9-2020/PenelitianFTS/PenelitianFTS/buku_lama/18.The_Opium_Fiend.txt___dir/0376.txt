"Did she say anything more?--do try and remember."

"Oh, yes; she further asked me how far it is from here to the dessa
Sikaja, and I told her that it is about two miles off."

"Anything else?" cried Dalima impatiently.

"Then she asked how far Sikaja is from the dessa Pringtoetoel; but
I could not tell her that, as I know nothing of the country beyond
our own district."

"Did you hear her say anything more, ma?"

"No."

"But ma, did you see her face?"

"Certainly I did," replied the woman, "why not?"

"And?" asked Dalima, anxiously.

"Her features were those of a white woman, though rather dark. Her face
and hands, however, did not correspond in colour with her feet. In
fact I suspected at the time that she had stained them. But perhaps
the nonna had been running about a good deal in the sun."

"And her hair, ma?" asked Dalima.

"It was tied up in a knot."

"What colour was it, ma?"

"It was as black as yours; but much softer, it looked like silk and
was wavy. Oh, yes! now I feel sure she was a nonna."

"Yes," thought Dalima, "it is she;" and then she continued aloud:

"She asked you no other question, ma?"

"No, nothing else," replied the stall-keeper.

Dalima did not stay long--a quarter of an hour later she was on her
way to Sikaja. How she sped there, we shall see later on. The day
after, she reappeared in Karang Anjer; but it was only to fetch the
bundle she had left behind her. Then she disappeared, and no one saw
or heard anything more of her.

Mrs. Steenvlak sent a couple of oppassers to inquire what had become
of her; but they returned saying that the girl had gone away, no one
could tell whither.

"She must have gone back to Santjoemeh," thought Mrs. Steenvlak. "Was
I right after all in keeping my word to Anna? Time will show. Anna
did seem greatly attached to her baboe; and no doubt, in her present
lonely state, the girl would be a pleasant and useful companion."
