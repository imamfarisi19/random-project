Here one of the men whispered something into Ardjan's ear.

"Yes, yes, you are right, let us cut it short. No, no--no pity, far
from it. You shall have a painful, a cruel death. I had made up my
mind to give you the most terrible--the 'hoekoem madoe--'"

Lim Ho uttered a fearful yell at these terrible words.

"Mercy! mercy!" he moaned.

"--But that would take too much time," continued Ardjan, who had by
this time regained his composure. "We might get the police upon us
before you were quite finished and that would spoil the game-- No, I
have given up that idea. You shall undergo the 'hoekoem kamadoog.' The
same punishment, you remember, Lim Ho, that you gave me; and yet I
had committed no fault whatever, and the kandjeng toean there thought
it right to leave your outrageous crime unpunished. No, you must not
be able to say that I am more barbarous than you."

"Mercy! Mercy!" cried both the wretched men.

"No! no! no pity!" rejoined Ardjan.

Then, with a signal to one of his mates, he continued:

"Strip them and take them outside!"

That order was carried out literally and in a very few minutes. The
fine light-blue coat was rent from the Resident's back, his trousers
followed and his shirt; and torn to ribbons they soon lay on the dirty
floor of the cabin--even the Virtus nobilitat was trampled under foot.

Lim Ho underwent the same rough operation, and then both men stood
there naked before their pitiless judges. Then their hands were tied
behind their backs and the wretched creatures were simply pitched
down the rude steps.

Ardjan reminded Lim Ho of the glorious fun he had eight months ago
when the two Chinamen and himself were similarly treated.

"You remember," he laughed, "how Than Khan and Liem King tumbled down
from top to bottom? It was fine sport to you then!"

It took but a few moments to tie up the two victims to the
Niboeng-palms, which grew in front of the hut--to the very trees to
which the two Chinamen and Ardjan himself had been fastened.
