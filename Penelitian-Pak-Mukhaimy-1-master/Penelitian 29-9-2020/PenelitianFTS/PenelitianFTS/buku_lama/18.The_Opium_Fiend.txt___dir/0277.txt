Bang! down came the hammer.

"Who is the buyer?" asked the clerk.

"I am," replied an officer. He was an elderly man--a first Lieutenant
of Infantry.

"Who is I?" asked the auctioneer from his perch.

"I, Langeveld, first Lieutenant of Infantry."

"Mr. Langeveld, do you pay cash down?" asked the auctioneer.

"Cash down?" asked the officer, quite surprised, "what do you
mean? Your office always gives three months' credit."

"Only to those whose pay is above two hundred and fifty guilders,"
said the man.

"Two hundred and fifty guilders? Whose order is that?"

"It is the order of the superintendent of sales at Santjoemeh,"
replied the auctioneer.

"The Resident," muttered van Nerekool, "a most infamous trick!"

"Do you pay ready money? No?" continued the auctioneer, "then you
will have to find some security, or else the lot will have to be put
up again."

The officer, who was a man of unblemished name and character, turned
fiery red at this wanton and unexpected insult.

"Lieutenant Langeveld, I will be your security!" cried van Nerekool.

The officer bowed his thanks. The second lot of flowers, however,
which was much finer than the first, did not fetch a rix-dollar. The
shameful dodge at headquarters evidently had its effect on the spirits
of the buyers. Grenits saw the drift of all this in a moment. He held
a hasty consultation with van Nerekool and a few landowners who were
standing by him. Just as the third dozen of pots were being put up,
a burly, broad-shouldered gentleman cried out:

"A word with you, Mr. Auctioneer. A disgraceful trick is being played
here--I never saw such a dirty thing done before--a trick which Mr. van
Nerekool, Mr. Grenits and myself are determined to frustrate. For
every gentleman who wishes to buy at this sale, and who may happen
to fall under this novel condition of having to pay ready money,
we will stand security."

"Bravo! bravo!" was the general shout.

"Does that satisfy you, Mr. Auctioneer?"
