It was indeed high time; for every instant the infernal din was
coming nearer and growing more distinct. It was, in fact, becoming
positively deafening. It sounded as if a veritable Pandemonium had
broken loose. Grenits made a very wry face when he found that Mokesuep
was to be his companion; but he had no chance of remonstrance at thus
being saddled with a most uncongenial companion, for he had to get
to his post without delay.

The positions which the guns were to occupy had been admirably chosen
and showed a perfect knowledge both of the game and of the ground. The
marksmen were all posted in full view of one another, so that there
could be no risk of accident, at the same time their fire commanded
the narrow opening of the ravine which lay open before them. Moreover
they were all directed to take their stand upon spots slightly elevated
above the level of the soil and were thus, to a great extent, out of
the reach of the fearful tusks of the infuriated animals. Thus then
they stood, most eagerly watching; but, though the entrance to the
Djoerang lay perfectly open before them with here and there a few
stunted shrubs much too low and small to conceal even the smallest
pig, not a vestige of any animal could be seen. This suspense seemed
intolerably long to the impatient and impulsive Europeans who were
far from being endowed with the calm phlegmatic temperament of the
natives. The Wedono stood there quiet and motionless as a statue.

"I can see nothing whatever," shouted August van Beneden to his
friend, making use of his hands as a speaking-trumpet. "I fancy our
good dessa-folk have taken it easy and have allowed the game to slip
away quietly to the right or left."

"It is my opinion that the ravine is empty," remarked van Nerekool,
to whom this long inaction was more irksome than even to the others.

Verstork interpreted van Beneden's words to the Wedono who, rifle
in hand, was standing by his side, and asked him if he thought it
possible.
