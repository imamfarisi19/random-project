"My dear girl, what are you thinking about?" asked Mrs. Meidema.

"Well," continued Matilda, coming to her sister's help, "I must say
I think the idea a very good one."

"But, my dear girls, pray remember that a needlewoman would have to
be paid, and pray where is the money to come from?"

"Anna van Gulpendam," put in Matilda quickly, "I know always has
her needlewoman."

"No doubt she has," said Mrs Meidema; "but you must remember, Tilda,
that Anna is an only child, and that she is, moreover, the Resident's
daughter."

"Is there then very much difference, mother, between the income of
a Resident and that of an Assistant Resident."

"I should think so, indeed," replied Mrs. Meidema; "the Resident
draws fifteen hundred guilders a month at least, and your father has
at the most but five hundred."

"So much difference as that," said Matilda, seriously; "indeed I
never thought it was so much."

"And then, Tilda dear," continued her mother, "as I said before,
the Resident has but one daughter, and we have five children to
provide for."

"Are children very expensive?" asked Gesina.

"You can reckon it up for yourself, Sijntje--there is food to get and
clothing and school-fees and--oh, ever so many odds and ends besides."

"It is a pity!" sighed the girl, after a while.

"What is a pity?"

"It is a pity that boys are such an expensive luxury, for they are
jolly little fellows."

"Now did you ever hear such a girl?" laughed Mrs. Meidema, "first
she grumbles at the trouble those good-for-nothing boys give her,
and then she calls them jolly little fellows!"

"Well, mother dear, you must let me grumble a bit now and then,
I really can't help it when we have such a heap of boys' clothes to
mend," and with these words the young girl laid her fair head lovingly
on her mother's shoulder.

"Money is not everything," said Matilda, sententiously, as she kept on
stitching busily, while Mrs. Meidema was running her fingers through
her daughter's flowing curls.
