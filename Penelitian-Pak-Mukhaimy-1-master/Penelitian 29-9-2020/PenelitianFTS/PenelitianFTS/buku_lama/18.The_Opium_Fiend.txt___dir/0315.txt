"Come, come, pray select a sample for yourself, madam," said the
Chinaman with a supplicating look.

"But--babah--" she began, "I have never heard of gifts offered at
Chinese weddings. I know they are customary at the New Year."

"Yes, yes njonja, you are quite right, on that occasion we offer
gifts all round to all our acquaintances; but at a wedding we only
do so to our old friends, and--I take the liberty of reckoning the
Assistant Resident among my very good friends."

"Yes, but babah, you know Mr. Meidema, do you not?"

"Surely the njonja would not refuse my poor little present,"
interrupted the Chinaman.

"Oh, mother, dear!" whispered Gesina beseechingly.

"No, babah, I will not downright refuse; but before coming to any
decision or making any choice, I must have a talk to my husband."

"Of course, of course," hastily said Lim Yang Bing, "that is nothing
more than right and proper. It makes matters, in fact, easier for me,
as perhaps, madam, you would not mind to intercede for me with the
Assistant Resident."

"Intercede for you, babah!" cried Mrs. Meidema now thoroughly
surprised. "You know that my intercession has but very little influence
with my husband."

The Chinaman smiled--it was a cunning leer, as he said:

"No, no, madam, I did not mean you to intercede for me--I cannot
have expressed myself properly--what I meant was--to intercede for
the bridegroom."

"For the bridegroom?" asked Mrs. Meidema. "Oh, yes; but who is the
happy man, babah?"

"Madam, that is a secret--However, I may just as well tell you at
once; as soon as you know who he is I feel sure I can reckon upon
your sympathy. Well, the happy man, then, is my son Lim Ho."

"Indeed!" said Mrs. Meidema very coolly, "and who is the young lady?"

"Ngow Ming Nio."

"The daughter of Ngow Ming Than--is she not? A very pretty girl and
a very rich girl too--I am sure I congratulate you, babah."

"And now, may I reckon upon you, madam, to intercede for Lim Ho?" asked
the Chinaman.
