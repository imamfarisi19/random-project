She hesitated--she stammered, she was trembling all over. Young van
Nerekool gazed at her with a strange puzzled expression which she
seemed perfectly to understand.

"The Resident," she resumed, "will have practical men and--you
must pardon me," she continued with slight hesitation, "you must
pardon me for saying so; but you are not a practical man. No, no,"
continued she hastily, "don't look at me like that! You are moving in
a world of dreams, which is very far removed indeed from practical
every-day life. You picture to yourself an ideal world as different
as possible from the one in which we live. And, I can tell you, if
you cannot somehow or other manage to wake up out of your day-dreams,
you will be in great danger of never making any way at all in the
judicial career which you have chosen. Yours is, in sober fact,
a most prosaic career; and the one of all others, in which dreams
and fancies are utterly out of place."

Van Nerekool listened to this homily with the greatest attention
and most submissively, though he felt arising within him a nameless
feeling of uneasiness which he had much trouble to suppress.

"I am prepared to accede to your request," resumed fair Laurentia
with her most winning smile, but at the same time emphasizing every
syllable as if she counted them,--"I will speak for you, and I will
plead your cause with the Resident,--and if I once consent to do that,
Anna will be yours."

"Oh how can I sufficiently thank you," exclaimed van Nerekool, laying
his hand on his heart, as if he wished to keep down its beating.

Very little more and he would, in his transport of gratitude,
have snatched up Laurentia to his breast and covered her with
kisses. Happily, however, he restrained himself,--happily, for who
knows what effect such an act might have had upon the excitable woman.

"Be calm, Mr. van Nerekool," said she, "be calm. I am ready to
intercede for you; but then, on your part, you must make me one
promise."
