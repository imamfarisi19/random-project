"Yes, mother," replied Anna, bravely, "yes, mother, for my love for
him rests entirely on the noble qualities which distinguish him from
all others. It is his honest heart especially which has won my love."

"Now all this, Anna," resumed Mrs. van Gulpendam, "is somewhat
frivolous."

"Frivolous, mother!" cried the young girl; "do you call it frivolous
that my eye has been open not to mere outward show, not to the
mere superficial varnish and polish of society; but to genuine and
substantial qualities, to sterling firmness of character and to
honesty of principle?"

"Tut, tut, tut!" exclaimed Laurentia, "these are mighty fine words
indeed."

"Do you disapprove of my choice, mother dear?" asked Anna.

"Disapprove," said Laurentia, gravely, "no, my child, it is not I
who disapprove."

"Oh! yes; I know that papa is not at all fond of Mr. van Nerekool!"

Mrs. van Gulpendam made no reply to this exclamation.

"Have you loved him long?" asked she at length.

"Yes, mamma; my love for him has grown without my knowing it."

"Come now, Anna," said Laurentia, with a sad incredulous smile,
"come now."

"I do assure you," pleaded the girl, "it was altogether without
my knowledge."

"How then, and when did you discover that you were in love with
him?" persisted her mother.

"You know, mamma, do you not? that he used to visit here
frequently--very frequently."

"Well, yes," said Laurentia, "I know that; but that is no answer to
my question."

"During his visits here," continued the young girl, "I was generally
alone in his company. At one time you would be engaged at cards; at
another you were surrounded by your friends and taken up in discussing
some article of toilette or deep in the secrets of a plum-pudding. At
another time again, you, as hostess and wife of the chief man in
the district, had to do the honours of the house and had to occupy
yourself with generals, colonels, presidents and such like; and amidst
all this business you had no time to devote to your daughter--"
