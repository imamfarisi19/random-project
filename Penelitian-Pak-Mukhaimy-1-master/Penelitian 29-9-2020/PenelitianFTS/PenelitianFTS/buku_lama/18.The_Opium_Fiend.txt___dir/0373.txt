"But, njonjaa, Nana has been staying with you here," cried the
poor girl.

"Yes, Dalima, that is so."

"But where is she now, njaa?"

"She has gone away."

"Yes, njaa; but where is she?"

"That I cannot tell you."

The faithful young girl twisted and turned her questions in
every conceivable way--most plaintively she lengthened out her
"njonjaaa"--but she could get no answer.

Did Mrs. Steenvlak really not know what had become of Anna? That was
hardly probable. Might she perhaps have some suspicion that Dalima had
been sent on her errand by van Nerekool? That was precisely what the
lady did think probable. She knew that the girl was well aware of the
affection which existed between her mistress and the young lawyer, and,
moreover, Dalima had, in the course of conversation quite innocently
remarked, that Charles van Nerekool had visited her in the prison at
Santjoemeh, and that she had received money from him. Mrs. Steenvlak
was very far indeed from harbouring any sinister suspicions against
Dalima; she saw perfectly well that love for her mistress was
the only motive that had brought her all that distance. But yet,
she could not help thinking that this devotion to Anna was mingled
with some feeling of gratitude for the European gentleman who had
showed himself so kind to Dalima in her distress. And again, might
not the girl honestly imagine that in bringing the lovers together
she was promoting the happiness of both? These considerations made
Mrs. Steenvlak very guarded in her replies.

"Njonjaa," began Dalima again, "do tell me where I may find my Nana."

"I have told you already, and I tell you again, that I know nothing
about it," was the lady's answer.

"But, njaa, tell me, do you know where she has gone to?" cried Dalima,
wringing her hands.

"No, I tell you--how should I, baboe?"

"But you know at least in which direction she went?" asked the girl,
still sticking to her point.

"Of course," replied Mrs. Steenvlak, "I know that."
