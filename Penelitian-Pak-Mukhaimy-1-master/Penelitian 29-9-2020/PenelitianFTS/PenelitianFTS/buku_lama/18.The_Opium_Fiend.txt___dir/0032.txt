Meanwhile, what had befallen Dalima that she thus managed to come up at
the right moment of time to rescue Ardjan from compulsory exile? As
soon as she had succeeded in gnawing through the rope which tied
her wrists, no very difficult task for her sharp white teeth--she
plucked asunder the knots by which her feet were confined. That did
not take long, and with a gesture of contempt she flung the cords
aside and was hastening from the spot. For a moment or two, however,
she stood still, considering whether she ought not to go straight to
the djaga monjet, perhaps she might be of some service to Ardjan. At
that moment, however, she caught the voices of the two Chinamen who
were coming down the pathway in quest of her. This at once brought
her to a decision and thoroughly terrified she ran off at the top
of her speed in the opposite direction. As she was speeding along
she made up her mind to go straight to her mistress and implore her
aid. But, the question was, would she listen to her story, would she
help her? Well, if she would not, then she would go to the Resident,
he surely could not refuse to hear her.

Thus, like a hunted roe she flew along, the thick forest had no terrors
for her, she was a true child of Nature and knew her road well, and
so, in a few seconds, she had disappeared among the tangled roots of
the mangrove.

It was in the early morning that she reached the grounds of the
house. The first thing she saw under the half open verandah or
"pandoppo" was the Resident's daughter. Her young mistress was quite
alone, she was lying back in a comfortable rocking-chair and was
reading a book in which she seemed wholly absorbed.

So Dalima glided very softly into the pandoppo and, without making
the least sound, with a graceful motion seated herself cross-legged
on the floor close to the maiden who continued gently rocking herself
as she read. "Nana," said Dalima in the softest whisper which sounded
like a gentle sigh, "Nana!"
