Even Setrosmito, who profoundly ignorant of the Dutch language did
not understand a word of his counsel's speech, and had for some time
been sitting vacantly staring before him, even he, at length, grew
attentive, lifted his eyes inquiringly to the young man's face, and
then kept them riveted upon him with concentrated intensity. No! the
rich flow of words had no meaning to him whatever; but the gestures
he could interpret quite plainly. He saw the whole tragedy unfolded
before his eyes--he saw his outraged child--he saw the hand of the
speaker go through the very action which cost a human life. With eyes
glittering with excitement he nodded again and again at his counsel,
while thick heavy tear-drops kept trickling down his cheeks. "Yes,
that is how it happened," he murmured audibly amidst the deep silence
to the Javanese chiefs while he stretched out his arms imploringly
towards them.

"And," continued van Beneden, with still increasing fervour, "if now,
after having thus laid before you the bare facts of the case, if now I
turn to you with the question: 'Is that man guilty of murder--who slew
another--yes; but who slew him in a moment of ungovernable rage, and
in defence of his innocent child?' What must be your answer? Is there
anyone here who would cast a stone at him who drew the weapon--and who
used it--to preserve his own child from the foulest outrage that can
be perpetrated in a father's sight? Aye but, 'this is a question of
opium-police!' If I could, for a moment, harbour the thought that
anyone present under this roof would, for the sake of the opium
question, desire to hear a verdict of guilty returned against this
man--why then, in sheer despair, I should be driven to exclaim: 'Woe
to the nation that contains such a wretch--woe to the man, who, for
so sordid a principle, would tread Eternal Justice under foot--such
a nation must be near its fall!'"

The effect of these words was simply indescribable, a shudder seemed
to run through the assembly.
