Then the final paroxysm would be reached, and the effect of the
dreadful poison would begin to wear off; and then the wretched creature
would fall into a state of utter prostration, of annihilation which
for himself, and worse still for his family, was indeed a cup of
woe. Then the smoker would begin to tremble all over, then he became
restless and uneasy, then his entire nervous system seemed to be out
of joint, then every limb would be racked with pain--then he would
moan most piteously, and cry like a child, sobbing and declaring that
he was at the point of death and then--yes; then there was but one
single means to relieve him and to bring him back out of that state
of intolerable agony, and that was once again to grasp the pipe and
to fight the disease with the poison which had caused it. Then the
wife had to run out to buy opium--where the money was to come from,
that was her business.

Then one of the children had to knead and roll the opium-balls
and another little one had to hold the lamp which, for that kind of
smoking, is indispensable, and a third had to make strong coffee which
was generally got by theft out of the government-plantations. And if,
from sheer want of money, all this could not be done--nay even when it
was not done quite quickly enough for the impatience of the nervous
sufferer--then the wretched man would fill the hut with wailing and
lamentation, with curses and revilings which drove its inmates to
the verge of despair.

Amidst such surroundings as these Ardjan had grown up, and although
he had not fallen as deeply as his father, yet in the years of his
childhood, the age which is most susceptible of good or evil, his
heart and mind had received the impressions which made it possible
for him later on to take service on board a smuggling-brig, and to
make him feel towards the company which employed him in its nefarious
transactions, such loyalty as we heard him express in the djaga monjet
before Lim Ho the son of Lim Yang Bing the opium farmer at Santjoemeh.
