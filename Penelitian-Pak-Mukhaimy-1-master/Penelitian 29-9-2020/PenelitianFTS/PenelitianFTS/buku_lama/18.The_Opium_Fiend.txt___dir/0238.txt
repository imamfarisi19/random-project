"I am not talking to you," said Verstork to the Chinaman, and then
turning to Mokesuep he continued.

"That girl, the baboe of the Resident at Santjoemeh, accuses both
these men of having perpetrated a terrible crime."

Mokesuep, who did not know Dalima, stood confounded when he learned
who she was. The baboe of the Resident! What if that high and mighty
one were to take up the cause of his servant? Indeed he did not know
what to say or what to do.

"Did you hear my words?" asked the Controller very sternly and very
impatiently.

The wretch caught a significant glance of Lim Ho who stood there
audaciously puffing at his cigar.

"I have seen nothing whatever of it, Controller," he replied.

"But I," interrupted Singomengolo in a taunting tone of voice,
"I accuse that baboe of having smuggled opium--I found it in her
possession--the babah and the Dutch gentleman can bear witness
to that."

"Is that true?" asked Verstork.

The Chinaman did not answer at once, vile and utterly depraved though
he was, yet even he hesitated. He could not quite make up his mind
utterly to destroy the poor girl whom he had so deeply injured. But
Singomengolo gave him a significant look and made him a sign which
was almost imperceptible.

"Yes," said Lim Ho at length, "that is perfectly true."

"Is that true?" said Verstork turning to Mokesuep.

"Yes--it is true," replied the latter with the utmost effrontery.

"Did you actually see the bandoelan find this box in the girl's
possession?"

"Yes," replied the wretch.

At this word Dalima fell into a dead swoon. The other men present
at the scene could not repress gestures of contempt and loathing,
for all were firmly convinced of the poor girl's innocence and of
the perjured scoundrel's infamy.

"You damned wretch!" shouted Theodoor Grenits beside himself with
fury and utterly unable any longer to restrain himself.

A contemptuous smile, accompanied with a still more contemptuous
gesture, was Mokesuep's only reply.
