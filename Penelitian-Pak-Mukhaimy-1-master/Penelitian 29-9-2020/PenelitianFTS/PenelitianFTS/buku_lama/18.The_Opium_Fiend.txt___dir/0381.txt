"Yes, August is quite right," remarked Grenits. "I ventured to go
and have a look at the place yesterday, and I have not yet got over
my feelings of disgust. But come, let us change the subject. Edward,
your boy has just now brought me a parcel."

"Yes, I sent him with it, where is it?"

"It is there, just over there on the piano."

"My friend," said van Rheijn as he deliberately opened the parcel,
"here you have a brand-new bedoedan. You see the bowl is perfectly
pure and the stem has never been used. And here is a small quantity
of the very best tjandoe--prime quality as Grenits might say."

"Oh yes," said Beneden--"that is, I suppose, for our experiment,
is it not? How much opium have you there?"

"This little box contains about twenty-five matas."

"How much may that be?"

"Let me see! That comes to about one centigramme."

"But is that enough?" asked Grashuis.

"Enough? Yes, Leendert, too much!" replied van Rheijn.

"Yet Miklucho-Maclay, in his well-known experiment consumed one
hundred and seven grains."

"Well, if you reckon it up as I have done, you will find that a
hundred and seven grains come to only eighteen matas and a fraction."

"Very good, in that case we might begin at once."

"Now please don't be in such a hurry," put in van Rheijn.

"Why should we put it off?" asked Grashuis. "We have now a few quiet
hours before us, such an opportunity may not recur."

"But, I take it," objected van Nerekool, "our object is not merely
to observe the sensations which opium smoking produces."

"Methinks," interrupted Grashuis, "that there has never been a question
of anything else."

"That may be so," replied van Nerekool; "but yet I fancy we must all
have some further object in view. Speaking for myself, I should be very
sorry indeed to have anything to do with an experiment, whereby--well,
how shall I best express myself?--whereby merely the animal side of
the question is to be considered."

"Yes, and so should I," cried van Beneden.
