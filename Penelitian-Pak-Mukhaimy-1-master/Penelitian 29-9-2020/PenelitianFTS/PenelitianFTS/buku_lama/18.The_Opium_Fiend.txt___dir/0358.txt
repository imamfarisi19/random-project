When van Nerekool reached the harbour, he found that there also he
could obtain no tidings. Neither the assistant resident of that place,
nor the harbour-master nor any of the agents of the steam Navigation
Company--nor, in fact any of the other shipping agents, knew anything
about the departure of a young girl to Australia or to any other
country. For months past no strange ship had sailed from that port;
and the boats of the India Navigation Company which run to Australia,
do not go along the South coast of Java but get into the Indian Ocean
by the Bali straits. It was evident, therefore, that van Gulpendam's
tale of two ladies under whose escort Anna travelled to Europe,
was a merely trumped-up story.

Weary and sick at heart, van Nerekool was forced to return to Wonosobo
by way of Bandjar Negara. There he stayed for a little while longer,
and when, in that magnificent climate, he had almost entirely regained
his health and strength, he went back to Santjoemeh where he found
his friends, August van Beneden, Leendert Grashuis, Theodoor Grenits
and Edward van Rheijn anxiously waiting to welcome him home.

"Well?" was the question of all of them as soon as they had made
inquiries after their friend's health, "well?"

The question alluded of course to his inquiries, for the anxiety and
the efforts of van Nerekool had remained no secret among them.

"Nothing!" replied van Nerekool fetching a deep sigh, "I have found
out nothing, not even the faintest clue."

"No more have I," added Grenits.

"You?" asked Charles in surprise.

"Yes," rejoined the young merchant. "I also have been at work. I
have made inquiries amongst all the commercial men in Dutch India;
but from all sides I have had but one answer. 'No young girl in any
way corresponding to the description of Miss van Gulpendam has started
from any of the shipping stations.'"

"You think therefore--?" asked van Nerekool.

"I think that Miss van Gulpendam has not left Java at all."
