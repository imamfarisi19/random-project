"And from nonna Anna, yes, Kandjeng toean," said Dalima.

"Then those two ladies will be able to bear witness to that I
suppose?" asked Verstork.

"Yes, Kandjeng toean."

"And I can bring witnesses to swear that this girl had opium in her
possession," interrupted Singo.

"Witnesses!" said Verstork. "Who are they?"

Singomengolo cast a crafty look around him ere he replied. He saw
Mokesuep quietly entering the little hut. That gentleman had taken
advantage of the confusion and had quietly sneaked away, while he had
a chance to do so unperceived. He had reasons of his own for so doing;
but Singomengolo's lip curled with a disdainful smile.

"Just now," quoth he, "there was a Dutch gentleman here."

"A Dutch gentleman!" echoed Verstork, now quite losing his temper. "A
Dutch gentleman! take care what you are saying. Are you trying to
make a fool of me? I won't stand such impudence, do you hear!"

"Muizenkop was here just now," remarked Grenits interrupting him.

"Muizenkop? why I have seen nothing of him all the morning!"

"I don't know how it is," replied Grenits, "he told me something
about losing his way."

"But, what has become of him?" asked the Controller.

"That I don't know--anyhow, he was standing here a minute ago."

"But," continued Verstork speaking to Singomengolo. "You said two
witnesses--who is the other?"

"Lim Ho," was the fellow's insolent reply.

"Lim Ho!" exclaimed van Nerekool in amazement.

"And Dalima in that condition! Now I understand all about it!"

"Lim Ho has terribly ill-used me," sobbed the poor girl "and--"
but she could not utter another word.

"And?" persisted Verstork.

"He and that man there held me fast."

"You villainous brute!" shouted van Nerekool as he shook his clenched
fist in the wretch's face.

"She has smuggled opium," replied the spy without flinching. "She has
smuggled opium, and I found it upon her--that is all. The gentlemen
must try not to lose their tempers. The girl is simply telling a
parcel of lies."
