"'But no, that is not the object. The object of the Government, on
the contrary, is to stimulate the opium trade as much as possible,
and if ever the now rebellious population is brought under our yoke,
the trade will flourish more vigorously than ever. The Dutch nation
must be made to believe that Atjeh really produces a revenue, though,
from even a financial point of view, this bogus revenue must result
in the direst loss.

"'In order to attain that object we have stuck at nothing--we have
poisoned and demoralized the civil and military branches of the
State--and have degraded men to the level of the beast. And all this
merely for the prospect of the rich harvest which the opium trade
will yield to the national exchequer as soon as we shall have forced
Atjeh to share the blessings of our rule.

"'Under these circumstances, you can readily see that it is
difficult--that it is in fact impossible--for me to do what I feel
it is my duty to do. That duty is incompatible with the position of
a Government official.'"








CHAPTER XXXII.

A SCIENTIFIC OPIUM DEN


The reader was here interrupted by a loud voice crying out in the
verandah:

"Donnerwetter! what has become of Mr. Grenits?"

"That's our Pole," said van Rheijn, folding up the letter he was
reading and replacing it in his pocket. "There is nothing specially
interesting in the end of William's letter, and I do not think it
advisable to allow a private communication of this kind to spread
beyond our own little circle."

The door opened and Dr. Murowski entered. Having shaken hands with the
prisoner and greeted the other gentlemen, he said in a queer lingo
of his own, made up of Dutch, German, and Polish, but which we will
not attempt to reproduce:

"Rather behind time, I fear, gentlemen, rather behind time, but
donnerwetter--!"

"Come, come, doctor," said van Beneden with a laugh, "no strong
language if you please. I daresay you fell in with Miss van Bemmelen
on the green."
