The man nodded assent. He could not do otherwise. This incident served
to rouse a general enthusiasm; the third lot of flowers brought eighty
guilders; the last no less a sum than two hundred and fifty. True it
is that before this last lot was put up Grenits had cried:

"Crotons! magnificent crotons! The Adal-adal! (Croton Tiglium); the
Camilla (Rothlera tinctoria); the Kamillakkian (Croton Corylifolius)
and the wax-bearing Croton (Croton sebiferus)! Who will bid for
them? I bid sixty guilders!"

A cheer followed his words; the game went on
merrily--seventy--eighty--ninety guilders! Higher and higher still went
the bids, until the two hundred and fifty guilders were reached. The
lucky man who secured the lot received quite an ovation, just as if
he had drawn the first prize in the State lottery.

That set the ball a-rolling. Chairs, tables, mats, lamps, wardrobes,
mirrors, pictures, all went for the same fabulous prices. At last
it became a mad charge in which every one seemed bent on securing
something, no matter at what cost. Long faces were drawn indeed; but
it was not because the bids were too high but because the prices were
wholly out of the reach of some pockets. It was in the back gallery,
however, that the excitement rose to its highest pitch.

"Twelve liqueur glasses!" shouted the auctioneer. They were very
ordinary little glasses--in Holland they might be worth a penny
a-piece--in India they might cost perhaps five or six pence.

"Twelve liqueur glasses!" again shouted the man.

"Out of which the bitters taste remarkably good!" cried Grashuis,
"I know that by experience."

"We might try some," cried a voice; "yonder in that stand I see a
decanter of bitters."

A cheer followed this proposal--a servant was already busy pouring
out the liqueur.

"What kind of bitters is that?"

"Maagdbitter," said a sienjo.

"Pahit prawan," translated an interpreter.

A thundering hurrah greeted that splendid attempt at translation.
