"'At the festival itself the following quantities are served out:
to each loerah and each petty chief two kedawangs, and to every
guest one kedawang. I have now lying before me a paper from which
the following words are an extract:

"'"It is impossible to give, with any exactness, the number of persons
present at these customary festivals; but seeing that every guest has
his portion of opium served out to him, it may be taken for granted
that no one who has the slightest right to be present, fails to avail
himself of it. At the opening of every cave eight kedawangs are served
out, and when the ropes are fastened another eight kedawangs are paid."

"'During the ingathering of the nests--but how shall I get through
it all? Let me try to be brief. The loerah of Goewah Jedeh gets 76,
the loerah of Goewah Dahar gets 64, the one at Goewah Mandoe Loro 44,
and the other loerahs receive 40 kedawangs apiece. The toekans of
these caves receive each 54, the bekels 24, and the sekeps each 12
kedawangs of opium.

"'But even this is not all. The dessas in which the ladders are made
are paid in opium, the persons appointed to mount guard over the nests
when they are gathered receive their pay in opium. The transmission
of the produce, the carrying to and fro of orders, the return of the
ladders, the guarding of the caves--everything--everything--is paid
with the same fatal drug. In one word, the entire thing is simply
an opium debauch on a colossal scale; and it is the surest means of
accustoming the people to the use of the deadly narcotic. But--why
should I further dilate upon this matter, my letter is already, I fear,
too long and I have still to communicate to you certain things which
I know will be of the greatest interest to you.'"

"Is there much more of the letter?" asked Grashuis.

"Yes, I have some pages more to read," replied van Rheijn.

"You have given us quite a budget already," remarked van Beneden.

"True; but it is extremely interesting," said Grenits.
