"I believe," said Anna in a subdued voice, as she waltzed, "I believe
there is some news about Ardjan."

"About Ardjan?" asked Van Nerekool, evidently perplexed. Not, indeed,
the case of Anna's protégé but merely his name had escaped the young
man's memory, his face told that plainly enough.

"Yes, Ardjan, don't you recollect, baboe Dalima's lover," rejoined
Anna, "have you forgotten him already--Oh those men, those men!"

"I confess, it is very stupid of me," replied van Nerekool; "but what

very pleasant to hear, though quite indefinite. It was a gentle breath,
something like a suppressed sigh, and sounded like a veil which her
maiden modesty cast over the unpronounced answer.

Yes--but--might it not have been her breathing somewhat quickened by
the exertion of dancing?

With the blindness and bungling so peculiar to true lovers, Charles
at once interpreted that sigh as a sign of fatigue, and somewhat
anxiously he said to her:
