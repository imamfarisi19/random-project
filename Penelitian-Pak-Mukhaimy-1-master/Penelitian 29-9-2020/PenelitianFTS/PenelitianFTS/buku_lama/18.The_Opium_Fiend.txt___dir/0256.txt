"My friends, our dinner is over. After yesterday's jaunt and this
morning's exertion, and after the very short rest we had last night,
you must all need repose. My servants will show you to your rooms. I
am going to work and, as I told you just now, this evening I am off
with you to Santjoemeh. I wish you all a pleasant siesta."

A few minutes later the pandoppo was deserted and towards evening
the five friends were galloping along the road to the capital.








CHAPTER XXI.

IN THE RESIDENT'S OFFICE.


Verstork was much too late.

After the scene in the hut near the Djoerang Pringapoes, he ought at
once to have jumped into the saddle and there and then have galloped
off to Santjoemeh; thus he might possibly have succeeded in warding off
the storm that was gathering over his head. As it was, he had allowed
another to forestall him. It was not long before he found that out.

"So!--that is your report of what has taken place!" said van Gulpendam,
in the most offensive and sneering tone imaginable, when the Controller
at length, after having long been kept waiting and after having times
out of number paced up and down the front-gallery, had been admitted
into the presence of his chief.

"So--that is your report is it? It seems to me you have taken your time
about it! Yesterday, before noon, the information had already reached
me. A pleasant dinner time for me when such things are occurring in
my residency. But the gentlemen, it seems, were amusing themselves
with hunting. Oh, yes! anything may be going on in their district,
then they see nothing, they hear nothing!"

"But, Resident--" Verstork ventured to say.

"Hold your tongue, sir," cried van Gulpendam, savagely, "I have asked
you no question, when I do it will be time enough to answer, and then,
I suspect, you will have no reply to make."

Verstork was standing there, in the office of his superior officer,
pale as death and unnerved and biting his lips with suppressed rage.
