"Thirteen hundred thousand!" exclaimed Kwee Siong Liem who stood at
one side of the table.

Lim Yang Bing had not yet spoken a word; but now he looked up, gave
one inquiring look at his rival and cried:

"Fourteen hundred thousand!"

"Fifteen!"

The real battle had begun.

"Sixteen hundred thousand!" was the opium farmer's ready reply.

Once again a short pause ensued.

"It is hot to-day!" whispered a voice.

The Resident cast a look at one of his oppassers and the man
immediately left the room. A few instants later three or four servants
hurried in bearing trays full of glasses in which the deliciously
iced champagne was foaming and glittering. The Chinamen eagerly took
them--it was so very very hot!

"Sixteen hundred thousand guilders is offered!" cried Mr. van
Gulpendam.

At that moment Lim Yang Bing's opponent seized upon two of the glasses
and, in his feverish excitement, he gulped down their contents.

"Sixteen hundred and twenty-five!" he cried.

"Seventeen hundred thousand!" retorted the opium farmer with great
composure.

Another pause, which was broken only by the heavy breathing of the
excited crowd and the clinking of the glasses, which under the able
superintendence of Laurentia, who stood behind a side-door watching
the scene, were continually being replenished by the waiters.

"Seventeen hundred thousand!" repeated the Resident.

"Seventeen hundred and twenty!" cried Lim Yang Bing's rival.

"Eighteen hundred thousand!" answered the farmer.

Another glass of the seductive beverage was required before a higher
bid was made.

"Eighteen hundred and twenty thousand!" at length gasped Kwee Siong
Liem huskily, as if he were losing his voice altogether.

"Nineteen hundred thousand!" cried Lim Yang Bing.

His rival was beginning to waver, yet he mustered up courage to mutter
in an almost inaudible whisper:

"Nineteen hundred and twenty-five thousand!"

"Two millions!" exclaimed Lim Yang Bing triumphantly.
