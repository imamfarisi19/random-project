As regards the girl herself, she is, just now, bending forward over her
work so that we cannot catch even a glimpse of her features. Her dress,
consisting of a simple jacket of light-blue cotton, and the sarong made
of some dark-coloured material, with a gay flowering pattern, proclaim
her to be a Javanese. So also do the hands and such parts of the face
and neck as we are able to see, by their brownish yellow tint. So
again does the hair which is combed away smooth from the forehead
and rolled up at the back of the head in a thick heavy kondeh or plait.

Aye, but--that kondeh, however carefully it may have been plaited and
fastened up, yet it at once awakens our curiosity. Little rebellious
locks have here and there strayed away, and very unlike the stiff
straight hair of full-bred Javanese beauties, they curl and cluster
lovingly around the plait, while the shorter hair under the kondeh
also forms crisp little curls which cast a dark shade over the
light-brown neck.

"Might she be a nonna after all?" we murmur inaudibly.

Our suspicion is strengthened when, by the side of the little stool,
our eye lights upon a pair of tiny slippers. These slippers are not
remarkable in any way, they are of the simplest make and wholly devoid
of ornament; but it strikes us at once that in Java girls or women
hardly ever wear such things, and then--more remarkable still--their
size and shape point to the fact that the owner's feet in no way
correspond to the broad, splay feet of the natives.

As we stand wondering and losing ourselves in surmises, the weaving
girl very slightly changes her position, and one snow-white toe comes
peeping out from under her sarong. The startling difference of colour
betrays the secret at once: She is a nonna!

Wholly unconscious of our proximity the girl looks up and casts a
single glance at the fair view stretched out before her--she utters
a deep sigh and--

"That face," we murmur inwardly, "where have we seen that pretty face?"
