"All right," replied Liem King; "but I vote we first go and have a look
at the Tjatjing, we may just possibly get to know something about the
'djoekoeng.'"

So our two worthies clambered down the rough log which, as we have
shown, stood as a ladder against the hut; the wind howling, meanwhile,
as furiously as ever.

In a few steps they came upon a kind of pathway for which they had
to grope with their feet in the deep darkness. They found it; and as
every now and then a wave would come washing over it, the two Chinamen
had to splash on in the brine. That, however, did not greatly interfere
with their progress. They knew the road well, and even had the weather
been rougher, they would have got along without much hesitation. They
had, in fact, not very far to go. In a few minutes they reached the
small river Tjatjing which close by emptied itself into the Java Sea.

At the spot where the Chinamen came upon the stream it made a kind of
bend or elbow as if, just before losing itself in the ocean, it had
thought better of it and was trying to retrace its course. At that
bend the mangrove roots retired a little from the shore, leaving a
pretty wide open space from which the prospect over the river would
have been quite clear; but the darkness was so intense that even Than
Khan's ferret eyes could make out nothing.

"If the 'djoekoeng' has reached the Moeara at all," roared Than Khan
in the ear of his companion, "she must have come ashore here. They
cannot possibly have got her further up the Tjatjing, there is not
water enough and the marsh-weed completely chokes it up."

"Hush," said Liem King; "I hear something."

He was right. In spite of the awful noise of the tempest a low moaning
sound could just be heard.

Both pricked their ears, took their bearings; and softly, with stealthy
tread they sneaked forward in the direction of the sound. Presently,
they almost stumbled over a boat which lay on the beach with its
stern half under water.
