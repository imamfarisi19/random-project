"No, my love, on the contrary I know just nothing at all. When I left
Santjoemeh both your parents were in excellent health and spirits. On
the very morning when I set out with Grenits--"

"With Grenits?" asked Anna, "Theodoor Grenits? Is he with you here?"

"Yes, my love, he is--but, as I was saying, when we started, on that
very morning Mr. and Mrs. van Gulpendam set out for Soeka maniesan."

"Soeka maniesan?" inquired Anna, "what place may that be?"

"It is a sugar factory situated in the extreme east of the Residence
of Santjoemeh. It was not until after we had reached Gombong that we
received tidings of the sad event. A telegram."

And then, in as few words as he could, he told the poor girl all he
knew. It was not much and amounted simply to the fact that both the
Resident and his wife had been murdered by a band of robbers. The
letter in which van Rheijn promised to give further details was,
no doubt, at that moment waiting for them at Gombong. When he had
told Anna all he knew, van Nerekool paused for a few moments. He
wished to give the poor girl time to recover, in some measure,
from the terrible blow that had so suddenly fallen upon her. She
was literally overwhelmed with sorrow and sat leaning up against
him weeping bitterly. Her nature had but little in common with
that of her parents. She herself had brought about the parting--of
her own free will she had left her parents' roof, with the settled
determination of never returning to it again. But now, death had
stepped in--death had made that parting irrevocable--death had made a
reunion impossible--and now, all her affections at once flew back to
the beings to whom she owed her life. Now she clean forgot all the
dreary past, she clean forgot all that was bad, only to remember,
with the greater tenderness, whatever had been kind and good. Yes,
she was, indeed and in truth, deeply affected, and, had it been in
her power, she would have laid down her life to undo the past.
