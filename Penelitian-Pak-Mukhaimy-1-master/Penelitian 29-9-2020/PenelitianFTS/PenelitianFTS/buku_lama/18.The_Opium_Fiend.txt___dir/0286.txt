Once again the secretary very impatiently asked: "Radhen Mas
Toemenggoeng and Radhen Ngahebi, I am still awaiting the answer I am
to carry to the Kandjeng toean Resident!"

After having looked round and waited a while to see whether any of the
chiefs thus addressed would attempt to say anything in justification,
Mr. Zuidhoorn, in a most dignified and impressive manner said:

"An answer, Mr. Secretary, which I will take upon myself to give
you. I, in my capacity of President of this court of Santjoemeh, to
whom the members, the priest and the assessors, in all matters relating
to this court, are directly subordinate, I, this morning, sent to them
my peremptory orders to attend here. The said members and assessors,
therefore, are in no wise to blame--they have merely, in this matter,
obeyed the commands which I, their superior officer, have issued
to them. The entire responsibility rests upon me. Be kind enough,
Mr. Secretary, to communicate this my reply to the Resident; and do
not, by your presence, any further delay the business of this court."

"Mr. Zuidhoorn, after leave of absence has been granted you, you have
no right whatever to occupy the chair. I enter my protest against the
course of action you have seen fit to adopt; and I call upon you now
to resign your place to the Resident who intends this day to preside
in person."

"Mr. Secretary," replied Mr. Zuidhoorn with the utmost calmness,
"it is not my intention to enter into any argument with you about my
rights. You will inform the Resident that I shall not resign my seat;
and that I intend, to the last moment, to carry out conscientiously
the duties of my office. Again I request you to withdraw, in order
that the court may proceed with the business it has before it."

"Mr. Zuidhoorn!" cried the secretary, in a threatening tone of voice,
"mind what you are about!"

"The entire responsibility rests upon my shoulders,
Mr. Secretary. Usher, clear the court, and see that it be not further
disturbed!"
