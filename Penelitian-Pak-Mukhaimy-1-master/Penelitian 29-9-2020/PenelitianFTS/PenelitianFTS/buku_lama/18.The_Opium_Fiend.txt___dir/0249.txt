"Now, if with these unfortunate creatures we compare the thousands
who, at home, drink their couple of glasses of beer or of spirits,
then it will appear at a glance how much more pernicious is the use
of opium than the use of alcohol. The former indeed, is infinitely
more stupefying and deadening, and thus, very much more rapidly
than alcohol, it destroys the appetite; so that, even when plenty
of wholesome food is at hand, it either cannot be taken at all or
else loses much of its nutritive value. Confirmed opium smokers have
repeatedly told me that, in consequence of their pernicious habit,
they could eat only a few pinches of rice a day, whereas, when,
by the help of a remedy with which I supplied them, they were able
gradually to diminish their daily dose of opium, they could take ten
times the amount of nourishment.

"Then comes another point, and that is the extreme fascination and
seductiveness of opium, which causes the most pleasurable bodily
sensations, which fills the mind with glorious dreams, which, for a
while, removes all pain and suffering, while it, at the same time,
deadens much more effectually than strong drink, the mental faculties,
in this depressed race already sufficiently dormant, and thus the use
of opium holds its victim much more securely bound in the fetters of
his fatal passion, than the moderate use of alcohol enslaves anyone
at home.

"Having thus, by degrees, come to the influence of opium upon the mind
and the character, I must certainly not omit to draw your attention to
the selfishness and self-indulgence which it develops in the smoker;
to the ever-growing indifference to all his surroundings, even to his
own wife and children; to the listless indolence and aversion to work,
to care, to trouble in fact of any kind, which at length, by night or
day, allows him to think of nothing but of his master-passion and all
its concomitant cravings, to the gratification of which everything must
be sacrificed, and everybody must become subservient. A gin drinker,
for the indulgence in his ignoble passion, demands no other service
than that now and then someone is sent out to fetch him his dram; but
the opium smoker, if he can afford the luxury of attendance at all,
monopolises the services of his entire household. One must work hard
to earn the means of satisfying his expensive craving, another must go
and purchase his opium, a third must stand by in readiness to fill his
pipe, a fourth must prepare his coffee and the other refreshments he
requires. It is true, no doubt, that he is not so violent and not so
noisy in his debauch as one who is under the influence of liquor; but,
when the effects of the narcotic begin to wear off and his pains and
ailments again begin to make themselves felt, then, unless the whole
family is at his beck and call and ready once more to minister to his
passion, he fills the house with invectives and threatening--then he
utters moanings and lamentations most pitiful and heartrending. If
to this we add the bodily and mental debility which the opium slave
transmits as a legacy to his wretched offspring, though the majority
of smokers cease at an early age to have children at all, then we
cannot help wondering what kind of miserable stunted race will be
the second or third generation from the present one.
