"Oh yes, all right, go on!"

"Yes," continued the deputy-recorder, "Mr. Zuidhoorn might well
look--and he did open his eyes uncommonly wide, for the chief djaksa,
who, a moment or two before, was sitting by his side close to him,--he
too had vanished."

"Vanished?" Mr. van Gulpendam burst out laughing. "I can picture
to myself Mr. Zuidhoorn's face!" he cried. "Mr. Thomasz, you are a
capital story-teller. Do go on--run off the log-line."

The deputy-recorder continued:

"They looked high and low for the djaksa; but he could not be found. So
one of the vice-djaksas had to be summoned. It was a curious thing
however, that, although a few minutes before two or three were present
in the pandoppo, they now had the greatest trouble to lay hands on
a single one."

"Oh!" interrupted van Gulpendam, "they managed to get one in tow
at last?"

"Yes, Resident."

"What a pity!" The exclamation escaped from the Resident's lips in
spite of himself.

"There was no harm done, however," continued Mr. Thomasz.

"How so? Go on with your tale."

"Well, sir, when Mr. Zuidhoorn told the vice-djaksa that he called
upon him to fill the place of the absent official, the poor fellow
most suddenly was seized with a violent fit of colic!"

"A fit of colic!" laughed van Gulpendam. "What fun, what fun!"

"Yes, and so severe was the poor fellow's attack that he made the
most extraordinary grimaces--in fact it literally doubled him up."

"Oh how rich--how very rich!" cried van Gulpendam still laughing
immoderately.

"And, at length--with both hands to his stomach--was compelled to
rush out of the room."

"With both hands!" shouted van Gulpendam, "come anchor,
anchor! Thomasz, you will be the death of me."

The deputy-recorder looked around with much gravity--never before in
all his official career had he had such success as a low comedian,
and, thinking he might venture further, he resumed:

"Aye--but--Resident, that was not the funniest part of it."
