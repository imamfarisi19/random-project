"His help? What? for the opium contract?" said Laurentia, with an
innocent smile, as if she understood nothing at all about the matter.

"Just listen to me," replied her husband. "If Lim Ho, in that matter,
you know, of Ardjan, should be found guilty and condemned--why,
then, his father Lim Yang Bing must, of course, be excluded from the
competition altogether."

"Why so?" asked Laurentia.

"Don't you see why?" retorted van Gulpendam--"If for no other reason;
then simply to shut the mouth of the papers. What a row they would
make if the father of a man found guilty of opium-smuggling and of a
barbarous outrage moreover, should have the monopoly granted him. Why
it would be worse than the noise about the capstan when they are
heaving the anchor!"

"But, my dear," objected Laurentia, "do you think that at Batavia
they will trouble themselves about the barking of the local papers?"

"Yes and no," replied the Resident. "The curs themselves will be
despised no doubt; but still, in self-defence, they will have to
order an inquiry."

"And you will be the man to hold it, won't you?" said Laurentia,
with a meaning smile.

"Possibly I might be, but what if the Dutch papers were to take up
the cry?"

"Oh, the Dutch press!" said Laurentia, disdainfully. "It is pretty
tame on the subject of opium. It will never join in a cry against it
unless it be actually compelled."

"Yes," said the Resident, "that's all very fine, but one never can
tell how the cat may jump, or what secret influence may be at work. If
Lim Ho is found guilty, it would most certainly be advisable that
his father should not bid at all for the monopoly."

"But," said Laurentia, "he is the wealthiest of the Chinese Company."

"I know that as well as you do," grumbled her husband.

"Put him aside, and your bids will fall instead of rising," insisted
his wife.

"No doubt they will--"

"And then, my dear Gulpie," said Laurentia, with a laugh, "you may
whistle for your bertes knabbeldat."
