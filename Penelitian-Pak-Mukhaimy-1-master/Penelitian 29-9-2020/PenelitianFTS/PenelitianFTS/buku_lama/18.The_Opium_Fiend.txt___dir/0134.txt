"What do you mean by at last," she rejoined, "I suppose that is to
be my good-morning?"

"Very likely," said he gruffly. "Now is this breakfast-time I ask
you? You know how very busy I am."

"Then why did you not have your breakfast before?" asked his wife.

"Why? why?" he grumbled, "that is always the way you women put us
off! You know I don't like to sit down to meals alone!"

"Then why did you not call Anna? She would have had some news to tell
you," replied the wife.

It appears that, after the party, Laurentia had not taken the trouble
to enlighten her husband as to what had occurred on the previous
evening. She had so much to do as hostess--and then she had not missed
a single dance;--the young men of Santjoemeh had been simply charming!

"Anna, Anna," growled van Gulpendam, "why, I have seen nothing of her
yet. You women never can have a good stiff run without being knocked
up all the next day! But--what is up with Anna? What news may she
have to tell me?"

"I will leave that to her--Anna!--call your young lady," said Laurentia
turning to Dalima, who just then came into the pandoppo.

"Miss Anna will be here presently," said the baboe.

"But meanwhile," repeated van Gulpendam, "what news has the girl to
tell me?"

"Oh," said Laurentia wearily, "I would much rather she should herself
tell you. She could much better explain it herself why she allowed
van Nerekool to kiss her last night in the garden. But, I should like
to know what paper that is there in your hand. You know I don't like
to see the rubbish at my table. There is room enough in the office
for all that sort of thing; and what's more you have my full leave
to keep all those things there!"

Van Gulpendam had taken the rather startling communication of his
wife quite coolly; so coolly, indeed, that it exceedingly provoked
fair Laurentia. She had, therefore, sought to vent her displeasure
upon something, and that something, she had found in the unlucky
piece of paper.
