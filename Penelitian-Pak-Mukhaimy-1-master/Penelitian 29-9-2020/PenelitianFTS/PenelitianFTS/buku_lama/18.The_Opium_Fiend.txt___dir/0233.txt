"Are you sure," asked Grashuis, "that we are going in the right
direction? It appears to me as if we were getting further away from
the sound."

But they had no time for considering the matter, for, at that moment
a female form was seen rushing from the hut and running to meet them.

"Help, toean, help!" she cried, as she fell down at their feet.

It was a Javanese girl, whom neither Grenits nor his friend
recognised. With dishevelled hair and stained with blood, she rolled
on the grass as she covered her face with both hands.

"Help, toean, help," she moaned.

Astounded by the strange and unexpected apparition, the two hunters
stood looking at the poor girl before them. In their amazement they
knew not what to do. Grenits, however, who could not bear to see a
human being thus grovelling at his feet, took hold of the girl's arm
and tried to raise her from the ground; but she shook off his hand.

"I am ashamed," she muttered, as she tried to cast the thick masses
of hair over her bosom.

Just then a man, a Javanese, came darting out of the hut, and seeing
the poor girl he ran up to her at once. With a rough grasp he laid
hold of her arm, and strove to pull her up.

"Ah!" she exclaimed; then, as she recognised the fellow, she tore
herself away from him with a look of the utmost terror.

"Help, toean, toean, help!" she begged, turning again to the two
European gentlemen.

"Let go that woman's arm!" shouted Grenits, boiling with rage.

"What have you got to do with her?" asked Grashuis, who now recognised
Singomengolo.

"She has been smuggling opium," replied Singo, and turning to the
girl he hissed in a threatening tone, "Come along, will you, or else--"

"Take pity on me, gentlemen, take pity on me!" cried the wretched
woman.

"Come along, will you!" shouted Singomengolo, furiously, as he tried
by main force to drag her away.

"Let go that woman, I say--or else I'll smash your skull in!" shouted
Grenits, raising the butt of his rifle.
