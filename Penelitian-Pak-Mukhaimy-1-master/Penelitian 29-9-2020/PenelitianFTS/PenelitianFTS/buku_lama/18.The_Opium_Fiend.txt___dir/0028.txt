"Have mercy, sir," they moaned with the piteous wail of a dying child.

But Lim Ho had no mercy to show his wretched victims, he waved his
hand to the executioners, who, at that sign, entirely changed their
mode of operation, and now the gentle fanning was replaced by a severe
downright flogging. The blows, laid on with the full strength of the
sailors, rained down upon the bare bodies of the tortured wretches,
their skin resounded under the pattering of the leaves, which, less
barbarous than the men who wielded them, began to tear and fly from
their stems.

As soon as that flogging commenced, the prisoners no longer moaned,
they roared, they yelled, they howled with anguish. It was the cry
of a wild beast wounded to death, which gathers up its remaining
strength for one dying roar.

The limbs of the miserable men now not only shrank and writhed; but
with the convulsive energy which only such extremity of torture could
lend, they clasped with their legs the smooth trunks of the trees,
they seemed to try and sink into them and bury themselves in the
wood. It was an awful spectacle, and yet, strange to say, no wounds
could be seen, no contusions, no livid spots even; nothing at all in
fact to account for such unheard-of suffering. The skin only looked
somewhat puffy, somewhat red and inflamed, and covered with very small
blisters. The wounds which the bodies of the victims bore were serious
enough, it is true; but they had nothing to do with the leaves of the
terrible nettle. In their almost superhuman efforts to burst their
bonds, and in their frantic contortions, the sufferers had forced the
ropes into the flesh, and here and there the strands had cut their
way to the bone, so that streams of blood were pouring along their
arms, along their thighs and loins, and were forming broad red spots
on the soft slippery soil. That anguish must have been acute enough
in itself; but it was nothing compared to the torture occasioned by
the leaves of the devil-thistle.
