While they were sitting thus the ebb tide had fairly set in, and
the water was beginning rapidly to draw back. Every successive wave,
as it rushed into the cave, was less violent and retreated also more
quietly. That went on until the fury of the water had entirely abated,
and presently they were merely ripples that entered the Goewah Temon.

"Now, my dearest Anna," said van Nerekool, anxious to break the silence
and to lead her thoughts into another channel, "now it is time to move,
or else we might be surprised by another tide."

She raised her head and looked about her. When she saw that the sea
was calm she also felt that no time was to be lost. She wiped away
her tears.

"Yes," said she, "we must get out of this place; but, can you
swim? For, you see, the water which is standing in the mouth of the
cave yonder is much too deep to wade through. Yes? Then that is all
right--there is no fear--we shall soon get to the ladder."

With these words she prepared to leave the stone on which they had
found a safe resting-place, and was getting ready to slip into the
water; but Charles kept her back, and gently pressing her to him,
he said:

"After the terrible news you have just now heard from me it may not be
right for me to speak of love. But, Anna, I have lately felt so utterly
wretched, and, in these last few moments I have been so unspeakably
happy! Promise me now, in this solemn place and in this solemn hour,
that you will not again try to escape from me."

She looked up at him. There were tears in her eyes, there was an
expression of heart-felt sorrow in her countenance, and she could
not utter a single word.

"All obstacles," continued he, softly whispering in her ear, "are
now removed. You are now your own mistress. Tell me, dearest Anna,
may I hope?"

She turned away her head and laid her hand on his mouth. There was,
in the midst of her sorrow, something playful in the action, and
Charles caught that hand and covered it with kisses.
