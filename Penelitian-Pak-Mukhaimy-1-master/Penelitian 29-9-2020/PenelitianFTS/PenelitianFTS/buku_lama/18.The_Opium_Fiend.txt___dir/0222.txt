"That is all right. You must be tired out, and I don't suppose you
care to return to your hut to-night? Eh?"

"No, babah," was the man's answer.

"Very well, my people will show you a bedroom, you can go and have
a rest. To-morrow I will pay you for your service."

As soon as the fellow had disappeared, Lim Ho consulted his watch.

"Nearly one o'clock," he muttered to himself, and then aloud he added:

"Than Loa, is the horse ready saddled?"

The servant replied with a couple of Chinese words, whereupon Lim
Ho rose. He put on a kind of cap without peak, in shape not at all
unlike a Scotch bonnet, then he snatched up a riding-whip and leaped
into the saddle.

"Don't go to sleep--keep good watch--mind," he cried to his servant as
he rode off, and setting spurs to his horse he was soon out of sight.

The main road which he took was a much longer one than the narrow
foot-path which Dalima had chosen; but by starting thus early he knew
he could easily get before her. He did not know that before she could
set off to her father's bedside the poor girl would have a good deal
of sewing to do, and he thought therefore that he had to hurry in
order to be in time at the hut. But his horse was a fine animal of
Persian breed, and he felt confident that it would bring him to the
spot before Dalima could possibly reach it.

It was about half-past three when he dismounted and joined
Singomengolo, whom he found waiting for him.

The pair of villains sat down to consult about the best way of
carrying out their infamous attempt. During this consultation Lim
Ho repeatedly showed signs of impatience at Dalima's unexpected
delay. They were still talking together when the day began to dawn,
and presently the sun rose, when, of a sudden, a dreadful outburst was
heard in the far distance--a noise was heard of yelling, of rattling,
of banging--it seemed as if the world was coming to an end. Lim Ho
started up in terror from the mat upon which he was seated by the
side of the opium spy.
