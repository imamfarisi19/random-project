Thus he muttered to himself as, in his father's house, he lay
stretched out on a most luxurious divan, with his long Chinese pipe
in his mouth, in which he was smoking the most fragrant tobacco the
Celestial empire produces.

"By cunning?" he continued, after a few puffs at his pipe, "by
cunning? Now, what is the most serious obstacle? The girl's will,
no doubt;--well, I shall know how to get over that, if I get the
chance, that will have, I daresay, to be a matter of violence after
all. Now what else is there? The njonja!--The baboe is in her service;
but I think she will help me, especially if--" Here the wretch moved
his hand in the manner so peculiar to the Chinese, when they count
money, putting down at each gesture a little pile of coins, which
always contains the exact number required, never one piece more or
less. "Now, is there any one else in my way? Yes, there is Ardjan,
who wants to marry her; but he is pretty well accounted for, he is
safe enough in jail, and won't very easily get out of the mess he
is in, as he is charged with having smuggled a couple of pikols of
opium. Long before he has been condemned, and has served his time,
the deed must be done. Yes, long before that Dalima must have been
mine! What, then--why, then? I sha'n't give either of them another
thought, then the question will be, what pretty one will next take my
fancy,--from Ardjan, I have nothing to fear, even if he does escape
punishment, the company will know how to deal with him. There is only
one man left against whom I must be on my guard, that is Setrosmito,
Dalima's father. Oh, that cursed Javanese, he threatened me with
his kris, did he? When I offered him five hundred rix-dollars for
his daughter! Oh, I will pay him out for that. But how?--A thought
strikes me--That arrest of Pak Ardjan seems to have been the easiest
matter in the world. If Setrosmito could be made to fall into the
same trap--if we could secure him--were it but for a few weeks!"
