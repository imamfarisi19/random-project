Mr. van Gulpendam flew into a foaming rage when he received the
message. In a towering passion he strode up and down the front-gallery
of the Residence, the secretary striving like a dog to keep up with
him, which his corpulence however would hardly allow him to do.

"What insolence!" shouted the great man, "what insolence! He shall
pay for it! But--what to do now? Meanwhile the trials are going on,
and we shall have an acquittal no doubt. Those law chaps are capable
of anything! I know what I shall do--a company of soldiers! I shall
have them driven out of the place at the point of the bayonet like
so many sea-mews!"

He rushed into his office--forgetting, in his anger, that such
Napoleonic measures are not exactly suited to the taste of the Dutch
people--to send a note to the officer in command of the troops
requesting him to come to him at once. As soon as he had written
his precious epistle he bellowed out "Oppas! Oppas!!" in tones so
stentorian that all the policemen and the whole staff of servants
on the premises came flying to the spot, thinking that some dreadful
accident had happened. Even the sentries, who were on duty, heroically
brought their muskets to the charge against some imaginary foe;
and, in this martial attitude, resolutely stood awaiting the things
which might happen. Fair Laurentia was at the time very busy in the
pandoppo discussing with her kokkie the mysteries of a fricasseed
chicken. She also started up and came flying into the office while,
with trembling hand, she sought to adjust her kabaja.

"What is the matter? What is the matter?" she cried.

But, before the Resident had time to reply, and before he had
despatched his note to the officer in command of the garrison, the
deputy-recorder walked up the steps of the gallery.

The moment he saw him, van Gulpendam knew that he was the bearer of
some tidings, and, not able to restrain his impatience, he ran to
meet him, impetuously crying out, "What is the matter, Mr. Thomasz?"
