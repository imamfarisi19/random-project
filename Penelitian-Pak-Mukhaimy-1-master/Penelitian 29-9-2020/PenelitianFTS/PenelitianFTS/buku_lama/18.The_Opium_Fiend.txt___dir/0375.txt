But Dalima did not sit down at these stalls to enjoy herself--she did
so because it gave her an opportunity of asking questions and making
inquiries. But, alas, all her perseverance and all her endeavours
were, for a considerable time, fruitless. During the first few days
of her wandering, she learned absolutely nothing. She was beginning
to despair, and to give up all hope of success. She was, however,
soon to have her reward; for on a certain day, as she was slowly
walking through the dessa Prembanan, which is situated about three
miles to the southwest of Karang Anjer, she obtained some information
which seemed to point in the right direction.

A woman told her that, on a certain day, about two months ago,
one of the poles of a light litter suddenly snapped, and a fresh
pole had to be procured. The bearers put down the litter and, as a
bamboo of sufficient length and strength was not very easily found,
some considerable delay ensued. During this time of waiting, a nonna
had stepped out of the litter, and had taken a seat at the stall,
and called for a cup of coffee.

"A nonna, you say?" cried Dalima breathless with excitement: "are
you sure of that?"

"Oh, yes, quite sure," replied the woman. "She was dressed exactly
like all Javanese girls, in a very simple sarong and a plain cotton
kabaja, and she had sandals on her feet. But those feet had evidently
been but little exposed to the sun, they were very small, very white,
and not at all flattened out as our feet are. I fancy that not even
the princesses at Sala have fairer and tinier feet; but for that
matter she might perhaps have been a princess."

"Why do you think so?" asked Dalima.

"Well, she spoke Javanese; but entirely with the a sound so that I
had some difficulty in catching what she said."

"You spoke to her then, ma?"

"Yes, I did," replied the stall-keeper, "she spoke with something of
your accent."

"But what did she say to you, ma?"

"She first asked for coffee and then for ramboetans."
