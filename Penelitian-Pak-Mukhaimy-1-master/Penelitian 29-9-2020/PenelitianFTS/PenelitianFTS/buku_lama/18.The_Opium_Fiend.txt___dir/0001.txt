BABOE DALIMA;

OR, THE OPIUM FIEND.


CHAPTER I.

AT MOEARA TJATJING.


It was a terrible night in February 188-.

A violent storm from the north-west was raging along the northern coast
of Java. The wind howled and roared as though a legion of fiends were
holding Sabbath in the black mass of clouds which were driving along.

The waves of the Java sea were running mountain high, and came
curling into the beach in monstrous billows topped with mighty
crests of dazzling foam. These crests were brightly phosphorescent,
and each breaker, as it came rolling in, for an instant shed a pale
fantastic shower of sparks upon the black seething waters, leaving,
the next instant, the blackness darker than before. The sea-coast
on which our story opens formed here, as in so many other places in
Java, an extensive marsh, the slimy clay of which the influence of
the tropical sun had clothed with a most curious kind of vegetation.
