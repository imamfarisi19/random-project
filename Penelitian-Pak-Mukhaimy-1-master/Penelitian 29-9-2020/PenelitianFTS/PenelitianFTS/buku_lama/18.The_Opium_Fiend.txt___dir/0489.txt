"'By all the gods, she was a pure-bred European! Face, arms,
hands, neck, shoulders, all were brown; but for the rest she was
lily-white--that beautiful creamy white which is so characteristic
of brunettes.

"'Then it all became clear to me--Miss van Gulpendam--she who had
so mysteriously disappeared--that face with which I felt all along I
was familiar--Oh, there was no possibility of a mistake, I knew her
well enough now in spite of the dark colouring of her skin. Though
the girls could not see me behind my thick hedge, yet they were much
startled and frightened. They at once snatched up their clothes and
fled up the path which leads to the hut I had seen on the ridge, and
as they ran I could overhear the Javanese saying to her companion:
"Don't be alarmed, Nana, there is no person there." Probably she meant
to say that the stone was loosened by the movement of some animal or
perhaps she ascribed it to mere chance. In spite, however, of this,
both of them hurried out of sight as fast as they could, and soon
the sheltering roof of their little hut received them.

"'It was then only that I began to feel how unpardonable had been
my indiscretion and, to spare the young ladies' feelings as much as
I could, I remained for a long time concealed. When I thought they
must have given up looking out, I sneaked as quietly as possible,
under cover of the bushes, to the bottom of the ravine, and there
a bend in the path soon enabled me to get away unperceived. Such,
my friends, is my adventure in the Karang Bollong mountains. I
have sent you this news as soon as possible for I know how happy
my communication will make one of you. I will not venture to give
you any counsel as to what you ought to do under the circumstances;
but I place myself entirely at your disposal and shall at any time
be ready to point out the little hut to you.'"

"Anna!--Anna found!" exclaimed van Nerekool, jumping up out of his
chair and striding impatiently up and down the inner gallery.
