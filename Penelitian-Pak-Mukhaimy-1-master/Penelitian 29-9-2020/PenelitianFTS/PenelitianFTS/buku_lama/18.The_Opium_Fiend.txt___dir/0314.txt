"Toean Allah be praised," cried the Chinaman in high-flown tones,
but with the sweetest of smiles on his lips.

"Now for your news, babah!" cried Gesina impatiently.

"Yes, nonna, I don't wonder at your curiosity, you are quite right,
the young ladies especially will enjoy it."

"But, babah, do pray speak out, tell me what it is all about," cried
Matilda as eagerly as her sister.

"Well," said the Chinaman, "it is about a wedding."

"A wedding!" exclaimed one.

"A Chinese wedding?" asked the other.

"Yes, ladies, yes, a Chinese wedding, as you say," replied Lim Yang
Bing, laying as much stress as he could upon his words.

"Delightful!" cried both the young girls.

"And who may the happy couple be?" asked Mrs. Meidema somewhat more
soberly.

"I may not tell you that, nja."

"Oh!" said Gesina with much disappointment in her voice, "then it is
not decided yet."

"Yes," replied Lim Yang Bing, "it is quite certain; it is so far
decided indeed that I have samples of the silk with me now."

"Samples of the silk!" cried both the young girls in a breath.

"Yes, the samples of silk. You surely must have heard, young ladies,
that on such occasions the betrothed couple always make some little
presents to the invited guests. And since you ladies will, I hope,
honour me by witnessing the ceremony, I have ventured to bring the
samples along with me. Very fine silk indeed; I ordered it on purpose
from Nan Hioeng. But you must judge for yourselves, ladies."

Therewith he produced a small parcel which he carefully unfastened
and the contents of which he displayed to the women's admiring gaze.

"Oh!" cried Gesina, "just look at that lovely green shot with red! what
a charming dress that would make!"

"And," exclaimed Matilda, "what a splendid blue! Dark blue with
flowers. If I had to choose, I would--"

"And will not Mrs. Meidema make her choice?" asked Lim Yang Bing.

Mrs. Meidema could not help casting an eye upon the seductive parcel
but--she hesitated.
