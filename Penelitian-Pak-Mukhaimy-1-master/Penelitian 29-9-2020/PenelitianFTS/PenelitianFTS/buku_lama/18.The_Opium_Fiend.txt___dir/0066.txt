Yes, the visit was a wholly unexpected one, for it was Sunday, and
about two o'clock in the afternoon, at a time when, of all others,
no man in Dutch India looks to be disturbed. About eleven o'clock
that same morning, Mr. van Gulpendam had gone to his club, and had
amused himself with a game or two at billiards. He liked to show his
subordinates that, though he had not cruised about Delft or Leyden, he
yet was just as handy as they were at cutting a ball into the middle
pocket, and had not forgotten how to put on side. About one o'clock,
he had gone home, had made an excellent and hearty luncheon, and then,
in the pleasing consciousness of being able to enjoy the Lord's Day
undisturbed, had put on his pyjamas and kabaai, and was just preparing
to turn in for his afternoon nap. His hand was already on the handle
of his bedroom door, when lo, his chief servant appeared in his usual
quiet, stealthy way, slid down to the ground, made a most respectful
"sembah," and softly whispered that Babah Lim Yang Bing requested
the honour of a few moments' interview with the Kandjeng toean.

"Babah Lim Yang Bing," exclaimed van Gulpendam, in surprise. "What? the
Opium farmer?"

"Eng√®h, Kandjeng toean."

"Show him in at once," ordered the master.

"But, van Gulpendam," said his wife, "what are you thinking about? In
that costume?"

"It does not matter, my dear," replied the husband, "we must sail when
the wind blows fair. But--oh yes--" and, calling another attendant,
he ordered, "Go and fetch the pajoeng stand here."

Laurentia shrugged her shoulders. "There's a pretty thing, the Resident
in pyjamas and kabaai, and the golden pajoeng by his side."

"It looks more dignified, my dear. You leave me to manage, we are
having a fair breeze, I tell you. Now you run away to your nest."

"Humph," muttered Laurentia, with her most captivating smile. "Very
sociable, I must say, all alone. Come, my dear," she continued,
"do send that Chinaman about his business."
