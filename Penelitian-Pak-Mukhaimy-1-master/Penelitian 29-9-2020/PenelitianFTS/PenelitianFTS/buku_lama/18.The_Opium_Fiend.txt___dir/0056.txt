"What tyrants you gentlemen are," replied the young girl. "Very
well, you shall have your sonata, but, after that, remember, 'Fleurs
d'oranger.' Now go and take your lesson."

The young lawyer went and took a seat behind Mrs. van Gulpendam's
chair, and, although he did not pretend to any great knowledge of
cards, yet he could not help admiring that lady's fine and close play,
while Anna did the honours of the tea-table, and was busily tripping
about to see that the servants did not neglect their duties, and that
the guests were properly attended to.

As he was seated there behind fair Laurentia, and was attentively
studying her cards, the glow of light which numerous splendid
chandeliers shed over the entire gallery, finely brought out his
clearly cut profile.

Charles van Nerekool was a man of five or six and twenty years
of age. After he had most honourably completed his studies at the
university of Leyden, he had been appointed junior member of the
Court of Justice at Santjoemeh when, a few months back, he had arrived
from Holland.

He was a tall, fair-haired man, scrupulously neat in his attire, and
most careful of his personal appearance. His fine, sharply chiselled
features had not yet lost their European freshness and bloom, and
were well set off by a thick curly beard and moustache, some shades
lighter than his hair. His winning manners, which were those of a
courteous and highly-bred gentleman, perfectly harmonized with his
handsome countenance, and he was universally esteemed an accomplished
and most agreeable companion. But, though society had justly formed a
high opinion of him, there was one point in his character which would
not allow him ever to become a popular man. He was a lawyer in the
truest and noblest sense of the word. A man who, deeply versed in
the law, yet would tolerate nothing that was not strictly just and
upright. Quibbling and casuistry had no attractions for him; he was,
in fact, honest as gold and true as a diamond.
