They had no time, they had no inclination, to admire the beauty of
the sublime scenery through which they passed. Whenever Grenits tried
to rouse his companion and awaken in him some interest in the glories
that surrounded them, the latter might cast a furtive glance around,
but it was only to cry immediately after:

"Let us get on, Theodoor, let us get on!"

Before setting out on their journey, they had telegraphed to Murowski,
and they found that medical officer quite ready to accompany them. His
colleague was still staying at Gombong and our Pole therefore found
but little difficulty in getting his leave of absence prolonged for
four or five days.

The travellers, however, did not arrive at Gombong until pretty late
in the day. They were tired out with their long ride and felt that
they must put off further operations to the morrow. Of that compulsory
delay they made the best use they could by calling upon the commandant
of the place to pay their respects to him.

"If you three are going on the campaign!" exclaimed the kind-hearted
soldier, "I advise the butterflies and the beetles to keep a pretty
sharp look-out. There will be slaughter on the hills to-morrow. I
hope you have a good supply of corks and pins for the poor
prisoners. However, I wish you success."

But while they sat chatting with the commandant and with his wife and
enjoying a cool glass of beer in the verandah, a servant brought in
a telegram. It was addressed to Murowski. He took it from the man.

"Will you allow me?" said he, looking towards the lady of the house.

"Of course, of course," said she, "no ceremony required for
telegrams. Open it at once; perhaps it is about some patient. I only
hope it will not interfere with your expedition."

Murowski tore open the envelope and glanced at the signature.

"It is from van Rheijn," said he to his friends-- "Great God!" he
continued, "what have we here?"

"What is the matter? What is it?" exclaimed all in a breath.
