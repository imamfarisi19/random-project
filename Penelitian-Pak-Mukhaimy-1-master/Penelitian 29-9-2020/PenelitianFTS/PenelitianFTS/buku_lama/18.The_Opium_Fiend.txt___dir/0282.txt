"I will do as you bid," replied the recorder. "You are my superior
officer."

"Very good--make haste."

As soon as the man had left, Mr. Zuidhoorn began pacing up and down
the pandoppo in great excitement.

"It is a monstrous thing!" cried he to himself, "I could not--I dared
not--suppose that they would carry matters so far! Yet I ought to have
foreseen something of the kind! Yes--I am a great fool--why! when a few
weeks ago I received a request from the Resident to alter the order of
the cases, a request with which I refused to comply, then I suspected
that there was some scheme on foot; but that they would have adopted
so arbitrary a course as this! A few days ago even, when I received
a written statement from the Resident informing me that I was no
longer competent to preside over the court, because I had obtained
leave of absence, even then I could not suppose that they would
have recourse to so high-handed an infraction of the law. Yesterday
the Resident informed me by word of mouth that he intended to avail
himself of the right of presiding in person; but I made no reply, for
I looked upon his words as a merely formal notice, and never dreamt
that anyone could be foolish enough to tamper so offensively with the
regulations of the court. Yes! for a most stupid thing it is thus to
enforce an old and obsolete rule, which was made when, as yet, there
was no idea of any individual being specially appointed as President
of the Sessions. But--what can be the drift of all this? What can it
all mean?" he asked himself as he paced up and down.

His eye lit upon the charge-sheet which the recorder had left lying
on the green-baize cover of the table. He took it up and began to
read out the cases inscribed upon it, making his remarks upon them
as he went on.

"M`Bok Bardjo: accused of secretly conveying away coffee! Poor people
who are compelled to plant coffee, and are not allowed to drink it;
but are obliged to put up with a wretched decoction of coffee-leaves!
