"Well!" said Meidema, "then all I can say is that the case is beginning
to assume a very serious aspect."

"Why! What are you driving at now?" exclaimed van Gulpendam. "Come,
man, fire away!"

"I mean that your statement directly contradicts the word of your
daughter."

"My daughter--the chatter of a silly girl!"

"Not so, Resident," continued Meidema, very seriously, "I have in my
possession a formal statement in Miss van Gulpendam's own handwriting,
in which she gives a detailed account of baboe Dalima's abduction,
of her forcible detention on board the schooner brig Kiem Ping Hin,
and of her rescue by Ardjan."

Van Gulpendam turned pale at those words, he felt as if he had
received a stunning blow; Mr. Meidema, however, did not allow him
time to recover his composure, but continued:

"I have further in my possession the sworn testimony of the mate and
the crew of the coastguard ship Matamata, which proves that on the
night in question they manned the cutter in order to give chase to
a surf-boat which contained two persons. That they fired upon them;
but that they were compelled to give up the chase because of the
tremendous sea that was running at Moeara Tjatjing in which their
clumsy craft would have had no chance to keep afloat. Thus you
perceive, Resident, that there were actually two persons in that
boat, and that, consequently, there could have been no room for the
opium. Moreover--"

"What else?" broke in van Gulpendam, who was gradually recovering
from his surprise.

"Moreover, the surf-boat was dashed to pieces on the beach. I saw
the wreck lying partly in the water and partly covered with mud,
and I have witnesses to prove that the cases, in which the smuggled
opium was packed, had not been in contact with sea-water at all. No,
no, Resident, I am firmly persuaded that the stuff never came
ashore in that boat, and further, that Ardjan has had no hand in
the transaction."

For a few moments the Resident sat lost in thought.
