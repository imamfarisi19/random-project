"'When one of the Chinese bandoelans, accompanied by a couple of police
oppassers, presented themselves at the door of Setrosmito's house
for the purpose of making a domiciliary visit, no opposition whatever
was offered to their searching the place. The only precaution taken
was that they were themselves submitted to a search before entering
the premises. On that occasion no opium, nor any vestige of opium
was found; not even under that very pandan-mat on the couch. The two
oppassers and the witnesses Sidin and Sariman, who were present at
the visitation, have expressly sworn to that fact. Sariman indeed has
sworn most positively that the pandan-mat was twice lifted up, and that
the Chinaman had most minutely examined the pillow which lay upon it.'

"That I think is plain enough, gentlemen, is it not?

"But now, allow me to continue with Verstork's sworn declaration.

"Very shortly after they had left, Singomengolo himself appeared to
search the house. He refused point-blank to submit to the usual body
search; whereupon Setrosmito protested and said: 'In that case, no
doubt, opium will be discovered in my house. I know all about these
dodges.' I have the proofs of all this here before me signed by the
Kabajan of the dessa.

"And, of course, opium was found, gentlemen. It was discovered in
the very spot where the Chinese bandoelan, who was no fool either,
had looked twice without making any discovery. That again is clear
enough, I think.

"Opium smuggler! The court will understand that I fling the odious
accusation far, far away from me. Not indeed because the charge has
not been legally proved; for I know that in these opium-cases very
curious evidence is often admitted; but because my client is innocent,
absolutely innocent, of any such offence; because he is the victim of
one of those detestable conspiracies which, as every one well knows,
are commonly resorted to when some obnoxious individual has to be
removed or some sordid wretch thirsts for revenge.
