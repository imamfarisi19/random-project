"Yes," replied van Nerekool, "I am glad to tell you that Verstork is
in perfect health, and that he is getting on uncommonly well in the
military world yonder."

"Well, that's a blessing," remarked van Rheijn, who never liked
soldiers, "I am glad to hear it--I don't at all want to change places
with him."

"And what is his letter about, Charles?" asked van Beneden.

"His letter is a very long one," replied van Nerekool, "much too long
to read to you this evening. The greater part of it, moreover, is
devoted to purely private matters; and contains particulars concerning
the parents of Anna van Gulpendam, which I do not think I have a
right to communicate to you. He tries to cure me of my love for her,
and I have no doubt that his endeavour is exceedingly well meant;
but yet the contents of his letter have made me very melancholy,
as they make the chasm between us appear deeper and more impassible
than it seemed before.

"Where can she be?" he continued after an instant's pause--"If I only
knew that then all would not be lost!"

The four friends looked at one another sadly--that letter had evidently
touched a string which vibrated painfully in van Nerekool's heart.

"Come, Charles," said Grashuis, trying to rouse his friend, "you
must not give way to that melancholy mood. You must try and accept
the inevitable. Moreover, who can tell what the future may bring!"

"But she is gone!" cried Van Nerekool hopelessly, "she has disappeared
without leaving a trace."

A strange smile passed over Edward van Rheijn's lips; but he made no
direct remark.

At length he said: "Baboe Dalima also seems to have mysteriously
disappeared."

Van Nerekool made an impatient gesture as one who would say: 'What
is that to me?'

"I happened lately to be at Kaligaweh," continued van Rheijn, "and I
chanced to meet old Setrosmito there. He tells me that Dalima started
off some time ago for Karang Anjer."

"For Karang Anjer!" exclaimed van Nerekool, "and what--?"
