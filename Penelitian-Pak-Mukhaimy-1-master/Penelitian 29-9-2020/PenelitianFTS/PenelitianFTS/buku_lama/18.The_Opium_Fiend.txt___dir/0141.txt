This done, the two officials walked for awhile up and down the roomy
gallery, discussing the morning's news, and making arrangements for
the day's work which lay before them.

Meanwhile, nonna Anna had exchanged her customary morning greeting
with her mother, and had sat down by her side at the breakfast table,
while baboe Dalima offered her the cup of coffee which she had poured
out at the little side-table.

"It is nice, miss Anna," said she, with a pleasant smile to her
youthful mistress.

Anna gave her a friendly little nod, took up the cup, and slowly sipped

upon her daughter's beauty, yet, amidst all this admiration, one sad
thought would come up to her mind. More than a quarter of a century
ago, van Hoop gave that thought utterance when he said:
