"And look, njonja," he continued, "pray look at those tigers."

With these words the opium-farmer pointed to a pair of red marble
tigers. The figures were life-size and were represented crouching on
two black marble pedestals at the foot of the two pillars one on each
side of the altar.

"Yes, babah, I admire them much--they are very fine indeed! They must
have cost a pretty penny I should think?"

"Each one of those figures represents five thousand guilders, njonja."

"But babah!" cried Laurentia.

"You see, njonja," said the babah sententiously, "when one gives a
wedding party of this kind, one ought to do it well. Have you noticed
that cock over the altar yonder?"

"I see it, babah, I see it, how exquisitely it is carved."

"It is cut out of a single block of peachwood," said the Chinaman,
"that little thing alone has cost me twelve hundred guilders."

"I say, babah! you must be a rich man," remarked Laurentia.

"So, so," replied the Chinaman inordinately proud in his assumed
modesty. "Do you happen to know what the wedding breakfast and this
evening's banquet will cost me?"

"No, I don't--do tell me, babah!"

"Well, I will--they will stand me in very nearly fifteen thousand
guilders."

"Why, babah! you must be a very rich man," said Laurentia in a
wheedling voice.

"Oh, not very," whined the Chinaman. "But you don't know how much I
give my son as my wedding gift."

"You mean to Lim Ho, the bridegroom? No, I cannot guess--do tell
me, babah?"

"Two millions!" he whispered, fairly beside himself with delight.

"Two million guilders!" exclaimed Laurentia, feigning the utmost
surprise. "Why, babah, you must have a mint of money!"

"No, njonja, not overmuch!"

"And all of it out of your opium contract, eh?"

The Chinaman looked at his fair companion, he gave her a very strange
look; that word opium had completely sobered him.

"And you have only had the contract for three years, I think,
babah?" continued Laurentia.
