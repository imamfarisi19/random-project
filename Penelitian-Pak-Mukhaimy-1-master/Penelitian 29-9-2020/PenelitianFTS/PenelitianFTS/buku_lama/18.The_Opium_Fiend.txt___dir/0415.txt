When first Setrosmito came forward some one uttered a loud
heart-rending shriek of Ah God!--this cry was followed by the usher's
cry for silence.

At the back of the pandoppo several Javanese women were huddled
together. They were the friends of Setrosmito's wife, who had
accompanied her into the court. She it was who had uttered the wail
which made all the spectators turn their heads. She had not been able
to restrain her feelings at the sight of the wretched object in which
she could hardly recognise her husband. Van Nerekool at once hurried
up to the poor creature, he got one of the regent's servants to give
her a kind of stool, and then he tried to quiet her.

"You must keep quiet, M`Bok Dalima," said he, "or else you won't be
allowed to remain here."

The poor sobbing woman buried her face in both her hands.

On all sides were heard murmurs of "The murderer's wife! Poor woman!"

"Silence!" roared the usher.








CHAPTER XXXIV.

SETROSMITO'S TRIAL.


As soon as the commotion produced by that lamentable cry had subsided,
Mr. Greveland began to question the prisoner.

"What is your name?" he asked.

The djaksa interpreted the question to the accused man in Javanese.

The prisoner with his head bent forward and his eyes steadfastly
fixed on the floor replied:

"Setrosmito, kandjeng toean."

"Where were you born?"

"At Kaligaweh, kandjeng toean."

"How old are you?"

"I don't know, kandjeng toean."

The djaksa turned to the clerk of the court and said, "Put him down
about forty years of age."

There was, in reality, but little need for all this interrogatory;
for the particulars had been already noted down during the course of
the preliminary examinations. The questions were, in fact, put merely
pro forma.

"Where do you live?" continued the president.

"In the prison, kandjeng toean," innocently answered the prisoner.

"Aye! but I mean before you went to prison?"

"In the dessa Kaligaweh, kandjeng toean."
