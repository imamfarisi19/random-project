"Ah," sighed Laurentia, "if you would but--"

"Yes, mother, just so, if I could but--But I will not. Suppose,
for a moment, that Charles were weak enough to yield to my
persuasion. Suppose I could succeed in talking him over, and could get
him to consent to your proposals. Why then, from that very moment,
every tender feeling would be wiped clean out of my breast. If such
a thing ever could be--why then, I would utterly despise a man who
is ready to offer up his duty to his inclination; and who could be
base enough to stoop to a crime, in order to win the girl upon whom
he has set his heart."

"Anna, not another word!" cried van Gulpendam, in the most threatening
accents.

"But, father," she continued, "surely I ought to tell you what
my feelings are. I must give utterance to thoughts which seem to
choke me! As certainly as I know that I wish him to keep a pure and
stainless memory of me--so surely am I convinced that he also, on his
part, desires nothing more fervently than that his name should dwell
with me, as it does now, great, noble, and strictly upright! Oh, I
could not, indeed, bear to face the life of utter desolation, which
would be in store for me were I compelled to despise him whom now,
above all human beings, I look up to as noble and great. No, no,
if such a thing could ever come to pass--then my misery would be too
great a burden to bear! Come what will, the memory of Charles shall
always remain unsullied in my heart."

Mrs. van Gulpendam could but heave a deep sigh, while her husband
was trembling with suppressed rage.

At length he exclaimed, in the tones of a man who has fully made up
his mind, "Let us cut this short, it has lasted too long. I take it
then, Anna, that you absolutely and finally refuse to accede to your
mother's suggestion?"

"Yes, father--I do refuse most positively," said Anna, in a tone not
one whit less resolute than her father's.

"Mind, you are utterly spoiling all his prospects in life," said van
Gulpendam, warningly.
