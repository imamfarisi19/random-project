"That woman?"

"But--" cried van Nerekool, in amazement. "But, it is Dalima!"

"Dalima?"

"Yes Dalima, the baboe of the Resident."

"Good," said van Rheijn, with a laugh. "Our Resident keeps a baboe--a
stock of feeding bottles also--no doubt!"

Van Nerekool turned crimson. He had not wished to say, "the baboe of
the Resident's daughter."

Verstork removed one of the girl's hands from her face.

"Yes--it is indeed Dalima! And you say that she has smuggled opium?" he
continued, turning to Singomengolo.

He made a sign to one of the wedono's servants, who at once gave the
young girl a shawl, into which she hastily wrapped herself.

"Most assuredly," replied the bandoelan, "I have searched her myself."

"Indeed you have," rejoined Verstork, "and torn off her clothing in
the process?"

"She would not allow--"

"And it is you then," continued Verstork, "who have so shamefully
ill-treated her?"

"But what was I to do, Kandjeng toean? She offered resistance,
and--look here, I found this upon her!"

As he spoke, Singomengolo held up to the Controller's view a small
box. This little box was strangely similar to the one which, the
evening before, he had delivered to Verstork. Indeed, if the latter
had not with his own hand carefully sealed it and had not sent it
off himself to Santjoemeh he could have sworn that this second box
was the identical one he had seen before.

"Did you find that box in the girl's possession?" asked he, very
sternly.

"Yes, I did," replied Singomengolo, unabashed.

"I have not smuggled opium!" cried poor Dalima, still cowering on
the ground. "I have not smuggled anything; they dragged me into the
hut and have ill-used me shamefully."

"But," asked Verstork, "what brought you here at all?"

"I was on my way to Kaligaweh. Last night some man came to the
Residence, he came to tell me that my father was dying. Then I got
leave from the njonja and from nonna Anna to go and see him."

"Leave from the njonja and from nonna Anna, you said?" asked Verstork.
