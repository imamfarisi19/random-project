"And now," continued the young man turning to the prosecution, "go on
your way, pile one judicial error upon another, erect for yourself
a pedestal so lofty that the cry of the unhappy victim of the opium
traffic--that insatiable Minotaur--will not reach your ears! The time
will come, when, from above, retribution will overtake you. The day
will dawn when the Dutch nation will awake out of its lethargy and
sweep you and your opium-god from the face of the earth.

"As for you," continued August van Beneden turning to the members
of the council and speaking in a more subdued voice, but yet with a
persuasive energy which it was impossible to withstand, "as for you,
gentlemen, place yourselves, I pray you, in the position of that
unhappy man whose eyes were just now dropping tears as I sketched,
in a manner which could reach his comprehension, the terrible deed
of which he is accused. Picture to yourselves the hours--the days of
mortal anxiety he has passed through, and is even now passing through
as his fate is hanging on your lips--then you will in some measure,
be able to realise the unutterable joy with which he presently will
hail the verdict which you will deliver--a verdict of 'not guilty'
which will restore to his wife and family a man who can so sturdily
stand up in their defence."

Having thus said, van Beneden resumed his seat, or rather fell back
exhausted in his chair. It was getting late, the sun was high up
in the heavens, and an oppressive heat weighed like lead upon the
assembled crowd. For a few moments, absolute silence ensued, the
silence of emotions too deep for utterance and which was broken only
by a sob here and there. But then, a tempest of cheering arose which
made the very roof tremble, and amidst which the stentorian voice of
the usher was completely drowned.

This applause and general enthusiasm continued for a considerable time,
and was not hushed until the president had repeatedly threatened to
have the court cleared.
