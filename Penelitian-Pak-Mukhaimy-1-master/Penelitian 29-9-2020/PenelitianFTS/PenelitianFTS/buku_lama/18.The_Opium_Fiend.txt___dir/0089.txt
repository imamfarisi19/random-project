When later on Singomengolo revisited the dessa where he first saw
the light, and where, as a thanksoffering, he had planted the most
terrible curse, his lip must have curled with a Satanic smile. Yes,
all he could now see there; those cocoa-nut trees overgrown with moss
and parasites; those orchards neglected and decayed; those unwatered
rice-fields and half-tilled fields; those two or three oxen whose
lean and sickly appearance spoke plainly of neglect and starvation;
yes, all these things were his work. It was his fault that now the
harvest was scanty and worthless; it was his fault that even that
wretched harvest had been pawned long before the ani anis had so much
as begun their work; it was his fault that clothes, furniture, tools,
everything, had been sold or pawned for next to nothing, and that
all had been swallowed up in the bottomless pit of that national curse.

But Babah Lim Yang Bing the opium farmer and his friends Ong Sing Beh
and Kouw Thang the keepers of the pawnshop and of the gambling-booth
were thriving wonderfully, and by their glorious aid the Dutch
Treasury also was doing well in comparison, at least, with former
days when those three noble sources of income contributed little or
nothing to that unsatiable Moloch, the Revenue. Gaily therefore might
the Dutch flag wave in the breeze, and proudly might the Dutch arms
display their manly motto "Je Maintiendrai" above the opium-den,
the gambling-booth and the pawn-shop--that much worshipped Trinity
which forms the most elaborate system of extortion under which ever
a poor conquered race has groaned.

Among the first of the infatuated wretches which fell into the pit so
carefully dug for them, was Pak Ardjan, the father of the mate of the
schooner brig Kiem Ping Hin. But a short time ago he was looked upon
as a thriving and well-to-do Javanese peasant, the possessor of a yoke
of powerful oxen, now he had gambled, rioted and smoked away house and
goods and had plunged his helpless family into the most hideous misery.
