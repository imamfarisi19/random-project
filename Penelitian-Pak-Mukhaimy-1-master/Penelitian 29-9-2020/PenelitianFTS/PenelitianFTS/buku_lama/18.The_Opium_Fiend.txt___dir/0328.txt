Standing thus, the four formed a group which would have charmed a
sculptor; but which must have filled with rapture the heart of any
true friend of man. The wife, the daughters, overwhelmed the man,
who a moment before had so brutally treated them, with kisses and
caresses. Oh, they could so well place themselves in his position--they
