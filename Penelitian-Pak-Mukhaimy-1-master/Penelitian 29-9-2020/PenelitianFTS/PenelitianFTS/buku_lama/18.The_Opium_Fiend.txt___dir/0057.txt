Hence his manner of speech was always frank and
straightforward--oftentimes he was too plain spoken, for he would
not and could not condescend to wrap up his real sentiments in fine
words or ambiguous phrases. Anyone therefore, who has the slightest
knowledge of the present state of society, may readily understand
why the number of his real friends was but small. A strict sense of
justice, a noble frankness of expression, and an intense love of truth,
for truth's sake, are, unfortunately, not the qualities which serve
to push a man forward most quickly in the official world--at least
not in the official world of India. Van Gulpendam, especially--though
he could not close his doors to a man in van Nerekool's position,
heartily detested him, and had repeatedly expressed his dislike to
the old judge who presided over the Council at Santjoemeh.

"Ah well!" this latter had, on one occasion, said to him, "you
are rather too hard upon our young colleague. Remember this Mr. van
Nerekool is but a newly fledged chicken. You will see when he has been
here a year or two he will turn out a very useful fellow indeed. Why,
every one of us had, at his age, just those fine idealistic views of
life which he now holds."

This answer made our worthy friend, van Gulpendam, look rather
queer. His conscience, at any rate, did not accuse him of fine
principles and idealistic views,--not such views, at least, as those
for which he found fault with van Nerekool.

The young man was still seated behind Laurentia's chair, attentively
keeping his eye on her cards.

"I cannot say," said the lady with a forced smile, "that you improve
my luck. Since you have been sitting there I have scarcely picked up
a card worth looking at. I wish you would go and have a look at the
Resident's hand.--"

"Thank you," cried her husband, "much obliged, you want to give me
a spell of bad fortune."

There are no more superstitious people in the world than your veteran
card-players.
