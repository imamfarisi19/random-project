"Now," said Charles, "you are exaggerating. What in the world have
you done to deserve dismissal! On the contrary, you have secured for
yourself the esteem and admiration of every honest man."

"Honest man!" said Verstork bitterly, "oh you don't know with whom
I have to deal!"

Van Nerekool's face twitched painfully--he had learned to know
something of the man with whom his friend had come into collision.

"But," continued he as cheerfully as he could, "but can we not think
of some means of warding off the blow? Can we not manage to avoid
even the least of these misfortunes?"

"Aye," cried Verstork, "that is the very thing I have been cudgelling
my brains about?"

"Have you any friends at Batavia," asked van Nerekool, "do you know
any one there?"

"Friends? yes, I know one man, a certain Mr. Reijnaals."

"What? Reijnaals--the son-in-law of the member of the Indian Council?"

"Yes, that is the man."

"Why then he is your man. Come cheer up and let us now together sit
down and draw up an accurate account of all that has taken place. That
account you will send to Reijnaals. And I also have friends in Batavia
who, I think, have some influence. I will write to them. Come let us
set to work and begin our battle fearlessly--it is no good moping." So
the two friends sat down to their task and when, very late in the
afternoon, Edward van Rheijn came home from his office, two letters
almost as bulky as parcels, had been sent off by the mail. Van Rheijn
looked weary and care-worn.

"You are very late," said van Nerekool--"have you been very busy?"

"Yes, very busy," was the brief reply. "I am tired out and am going
to lie down a bit."

"Anything particular?"

"No, nothing very particular; but plenty of work."

"What about?" asked van Nerekool.

"Excuse me," replied van Rheijn putting his fingers to his lips,
"they are office-secrets which I am not at liberty to reveal."

With these words he involuntarily cast a pitying look on William
Verstork.
