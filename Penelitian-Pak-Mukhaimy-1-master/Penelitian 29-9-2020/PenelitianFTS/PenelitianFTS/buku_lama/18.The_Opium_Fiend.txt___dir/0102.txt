"Boleh; tapeh--mentega sama ikan."

At the first word, "Boleh," which signifies "it is possible, it might
be done," the dull eye of the old hag brightened; but, at the remainder
of the sentence, she looked up with genuine surprise.

Yes, the purely idiomatic Dutch expression, though rendered most
correctly in Malay, was beyond her.

"Mentega sama ikan?" she asked, in a strangely puzzled tone of voice.

"To be sure," repeated Laurentia, in Malay. "Sauce with the fish. Don't
you understand me, nènèh? Cash down, I mean, M`Bok, cash down! I am
not going to be taken in by empty promises."

"Alas!" sighed the old woman, who now saw clearly enough what was
meant by "Sauce with the fish." She drew a little box out of the
folds of the sash which confined the sarong around her scraggy hips,
and offered it to the njonja. It contained a pair of valuable golden
ear-rings of Chinese workmanship, richly set with diamonds.

"Is that all?" asked Mrs. van Gulpendam, with a contemptuous smile.

"They are very valuable," muttered the old hag.

But the Resident's wife slowly shook her head.

"Lim Ho asked me," continued M`Bok, "to tell you that he intends
to come and personally express his gratitude to you as soon as the
affair has succeeded."

Laurentia laughed, "When the affair has succeeded," she repeated,
scornfully. "A pretty story, indeed! No, I don't intend to see the
babah at all."

"But, njonja--"

"That will do," said Laurentia; "not another word about it. Come,"
continued she, "you may take those things away with you again."

"But what then am I to tell Lim Ho?" asked the nènèh.

"You may tell him just whatever you like, nèh."

"But, njonja--"

"Now, M`Bok," said Laurentia, resolutely, "not another word on that
subject. Don't forget to bring me a good supply of the obat."

"Has the njonja no other orders for me?"

"None at present," was the answer.

"I only wished to tell you that I have another little lot of jewellery
at home," insisted the old hag; "ear-rings, rings--!"
