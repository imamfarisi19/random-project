No sooner had he left, than the representative of Gladbach &
Co. whispered a few words to the auctioneer. The latter made a
sign to one of his servants. Hereupon the gong began to clash more
horribly than before, a shower of blows fell on the metal disc. This
infernal din lasted for a space of ten minutes, and then suddenly
ceased altogether.

The proceedings now began.

The sale was opened in the front gallery in which a very fine
collection of flowers in ornamental pots and tubs, were tastefully
arranged in groups of a dozen, on the steps which led up to the
verandah. These were the first lots to be disposed of.

"Twelve pots of flowers!" began the auctioneer, "who will make a bid
for them?"

"One guilder!" cried someone in the crowd.

"One guilder bid, one guilder!" cried the auctioneer in the usual
drawl.

"One and a half!"

"One and a half," repeated the auctioneer.

"Two guilders! Three guilders! Four guilders! Five guilders!" came
the bids in quick succession.

"Five guilders! Five guilders bid!" cried the auctioneer, "Who bids
higher? Five guilders are bid," drawled the auctioneer, as he turned
his head and stared hard at the last bidder but one.

"Eight guilders!" cried the latter.

"Eight guilders!" cried the echo, "who bids higher?" Then the fire
opened again.

"And a quarter," cried a voice.

"Eight and a half!"

"Eight three quarters!"

"Nine guilders!"

"Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen!"

"Thirteen guilders," cried the auctioneer, "who bids more than
thirteen?"

"I wouldn't mind," cried a voice, "if I only knew how to get those
confounded pots home to Santjoemeh."

"Never mind that," shouted another, "I will take them for you in
my cart."

"Thirteen, twice!" said the auctioneer.

"Fourteen, fifteen," went the bids.

"Fifteen!--once!" said the auctioneer.

"Twenty guilders!" shouted a voice which rang out above all the noise.

"A fine bid," murmured Grenits.

"Twenty guilders, once--Twenty, twice--Twenty for the third and
last time!"
