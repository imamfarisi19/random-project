"Yet," rejoined Anna, "it seems to me a very mysterious thing."

"If there were anybody there at all," continued Dalima, "it must have
been a white man."

"A white man, Dalima!"

"Yes, it is now so long ago that I do not mind telling you all about
it. A few days earlier it would only have made you nervous. The
evening before we were frightened by the fall of that stone, a white
man arrived at Ajo, and passed the night in the loerah's house."

"Dalima!" cried Anna, in dismay, "who was he?"

"I can't tell you, Nana. I have tried hard enough to find out; but
I have discovered nothing further than that he busied himself with
butterfly catching. Pah!"

We may mention here that the natives of Java are, as a rule, afraid of
butterflies. They fancy that the dust from their wings produces violent
itching and even leprosy. Hence Dalima's exclamation of disgust.

"Did you see him, Dalima?" continued Anna, "did he see you?"

"Well, no, Nana, I did not. In fact next morning he started before
daybreak. The last that was seen of him was at Pringtoetoel, he was
then going in an easterly direction."

"Why did you not tell me this at once?" asked Anna.

"Why should I have done so? It would only have disturbed you for
nothing. What was the use of troubling you to no purpose?"

For a few moments the girls spoke not a word.

Dalima, who was beginning to fear that Anna was really displeased,
at length broke the silence and said:

"You are not angry with me, Nana?"

"Angry? no, Dalima."

"What makes you look so serious then?"

"I wish we could move to some other place," sighed Anna.

"Move? why?" cried Dalima.

"Yes, move away, further into the mountain, where the country is
wilder and more lonely. Yonder close by the birds-nest grots. I wish
I could retreat into one of those caves!"

"What are you thinking about, Nana?" cried Dalima, growing seriously
alarmed at her friend's words.

"Oh, I have some kind of presentiment that Charles is on my track,"
sighed Anna.
