All this the girls mightily enjoyed, and they had many a hearty laugh
over the love-lorn looks of the village swains. One day Dalima merrily
said to her young mistress:

"If they only knew that they were casting sheeps' eyes at a resident's
daughter, wouldn't they fly back in terror?"

"Hush, Dalima, do not mention such a thing again," said Anna very
seriously. "You ought to know that I dislike any such allusions. I
am no longer a resident's daughter!"

But, when she perceived that her scolding tone of voice really grieved
her companion, she continued with a pleasant smile:

"As if the young men of Ajo ever gave me a look!"

"But, Nana," asked Dalima, "whom do they look at then?"

"They have evidently taken a fancy to one of us," replied Anna,
"but it is certainly not to me; I can see that plainly enough. All
those smiles and sweet little whispers are for you, Dalima."

"How can you talk such nonsense!" said Dalima half-crossly.

"I am only telling you the truth, Dalima."

"Have you ever noticed Kjahi Wangsa, Nana? He has no eyes but for you."

"No, no, Dalima, for you."

"No, for you, Nana!"

And so the girls would run on almost daily, and on such occasions it
would have been hard to say who had the last word.

One day, as they were thus merrily talking, Anna said to her friend:
"What if it were the Kjahi who gave us that fright the other day?"

"What do you mean, Nana?"

"I mean that it might have been that booby watching us."

"There is not the least fear of that," replied Dalima, "he would never
have dared to do such a thing. Not one of the young fellows are bold
enough for that--he, least of all."

"Not much boldness required for that," laughed Anna, "to play the
spy on two young girls!"

"Well, I tell you, he would not have dared to do it. But you need
not trouble yourself, there was no one there at all. You know how
long we kept looking about and, though we had a view of the path for
a long way to the right and left, we saw not a single soul."
