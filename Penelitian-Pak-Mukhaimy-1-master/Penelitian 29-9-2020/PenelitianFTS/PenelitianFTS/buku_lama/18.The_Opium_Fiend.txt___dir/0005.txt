"Look out," shouted the other. "Look, there she is again, yes,
she is making for the Moeara. If she can get behind the 'bow-nets'
she is safe enough."

"If she can get under the lee of the bow-nets, perhaps, but, but--"

"Another boat," exclaimed Liem King. "There are white men in her."

The words were no sooner uttered than two, three, four sharp reports
were heard. They were rifle-shots fired from the boat, upon the
occupants of the "djoekoeng." With what result who could tell? For
a single instant only, the faint gleam of some gigantic breaker had
revealed the two boats to the pair of spies. The next moment all was
deep darkness again, and, gaze as intently as they would, not even
their sharp eyes could discover anything further.

Thus a quarter of an hour passed away, when suddenly Than Khan
exclaimed, "A steamer!"

Sure enough, far out at sea, shone the well-known green and red lights,
and, high above them, the white light at the mast-head.

"The guard-ship!" cried Liem King.

"No doubt of it," said the other, "it must be the Matamata. Well,
all I can say is that if the Kiem Ping Hin has left her anchorage she
is not showing any lights; she has got away safe enough by this time."

"Come, I think we may be off home to the Kampong; no smugglers will
come ashore to-night, you may be sure."

For a while longer did the two Celestials keep watching the steamer's
movements. First she showed her three lights plainly enough, she
was therefore making straight for the land. After a time, however,
all of a sudden, her green light disappeared, leaving for a while
the red light only visible. Presently that also went out and only the
white top-mast light remained visible, and, as it seemed stationary,
our Chinamen concluded that the steamer had anchored or was perhaps
moving with her head to the wind.

Said Than Khan at length, "It is no use staying here; while that cursed
Matamata is about they will not be able to get anything ashore. Come,
let us be going."
