"Devil take her!" exclaimed Liem King, "that tit-bit is lost to us."

"Indeed she is," sighed Than Khan; "we have allowed a nice little
sum to slip through our fingers. Lim Ho would have paid well for her."

"Now, I think," said Liem King, "the best thing will be not to breathe
a word about her to the Company."

"Oh, of course, not a single word," assented Than Khan; "now that
she has got away that would be most dangerous."

"But what," asked the other, "had we better do now with Ardjan? I think
we had better let him go, too. He is sure to let out all about Dalima."

"No fear," rejoined Than Khan, "he won't dare to do that. Should
he utter a single word about the girl Lim Ho would have him clubbed
to death."

"Well," said Liem King, pensively, "for all that I think the safest
plan is to let him go."

"H'm," said the other, "why so? You know as well as I do that he
ought to be on board the Kiem Ping Hin. Now, how on earth did he
manage to get here in that 'djoekoeng?' Take my word for it, there
is some mystery about that. Very likely it may be important to the
Company to get to the bottom of that. Ah," added he, with a deep sigh
of disappointment, "I only wish we had tied up that wretched girl a
little more securely."

"Oh, no, don't say so!" cried Liem King, "you would have bruised
those darling little wrists and dainty ankles."

"Bah!" cried Than Khan. "What nonsense, I wish we had her here;
now she is off. Where can she have got to?"

"Yes," replied Liem King, "that is the question, where to look for
her. But come along, let us hurry back or else we may find the other
bird flown too. There is something, you know, that tells me we have
made a good catch in him."

So the two rascals got back to the hut, and found Ardjan lying there
quietly enough, just as they left him. He had not been able to stir
hand or foot. As soon as he saw that the Chinamen came back alone
his eye brightened.

"Where is Dalima?" he exclaimed, most anxiously.
