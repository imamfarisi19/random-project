"Meanwhile," interrupted van Nerekool, "they may appoint some other
member of the court for the time being, to get through the unfinished
cases."

"Yes," replied Mr. Zuidhoorn. "They could do that no doubt; but they
will not. You know well enough that in case of absence on leave,
the Resident has the power himself to preside at the Council."

"Yes," said van Nerekool; "what if he did?"

"If he did," continued Mr. Zuidhoorn, "it is obvious enough what
would happen. As soon as I am gone, the Resident will take Ardjan's
case himself."

"But, my dear sir," said van Nerekool, "why should he do such a thing?"

"How can I tell why?" replied the other. "You recollect how, some time
ago, a colonial minister wrote to the king and drew his majesty's
attention to the fact that officials are systematically bribed by
the opium farmers, and that thus the authority of those who have to
carry out the laws is undermined, seeing that they are wholly under
the influence of the Chinese opium farmers and smugglers. Look you,
my dear sir, I have much more experience in these matters than you can
have, and when I come to consider the evident anxiety there seems to
exist at headquarters, to have this case of Ardjan's put off to the
last, then I cannot but suspect that an attempt is being made to get
the case out of the hands of the unprejudiced and competent judge."

"But," exclaimed van Nerekool, indignantly, "that is most monstrous,
it is infamous."

"No doubt it is," quietly said the President.

"And what course have you taken?" asked van Nerekool.

"I have taken the only course I could take," replied Mr. Zuidhoorn. "I
have simply done my duty. I have already told you that I have flatly
refused to put off the case. It will, therefore, come before us in
its proper turn, that is to say, about Tuesday fortnight."

It was not, however, to be so.

A few days before the above conversation took place between the legal
officials, the Resident, Mr. van Gulpendam, received an unexpected
visit.
