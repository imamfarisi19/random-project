Thereupon Murowski produced his instruments; a couple of thermometers,
a hygrometer, an aneroid barometer, a stethoscope, and a small
chemical balance.

While he was arranging these, van Rheijn opened the other parcel,
which contained a bedoedan and a small box of tjandoe.

"I say," cried van Beneden, who was the first to open the little box,
"precious nasty stuff this looks!"

Murowski took the box from him, examined the contents, and then
falling at once into a lecturing tone, he began:

"Opium is an amorphous, sticky substance which, being of a gummy
nature, is not fissile but plastic. It is of a dark brown colour,
possesses a faint sweetish smell, and is somewhat oily to the
touch. Its chief constituents are morphine and narcotine, in the
absence of these the drug has no value."

"But," interrupted van Beneden somewhat impatiently, "which of us is
to submit to the experiment?"

"The best plan to settle that question," said van Rheijn, "would be,
I think, to draw lots."

"Very good," put in Murowski, "providing you allow me to stand out,
as I shall have to watch the experiment."

"Now, I think," suggested Grenits, "you had better let me make
the trial."

"Why you, rather than anyone of us?"

"Why, because, being a prisoner," replied Grenits, "I have plenty of
time on my hands to get over the effects of the debauch."

"You are quite right," said van Rheijn, "I never thought of that--I
must be at my office as usual to-morrow morning."

"And I," continued van Beneden, "I have to be in court, on Setrosmito's
business, you know."

"Of course, of course!" cried all in chorus, "not one of us must,
on any account, miss that trial."

"Very good," said Grenits, "we are all agreed then that I am to be
the smoker."

"It is very kind of you, Theodoor, to make the offer."

"All right, I am quite ready to begin."

"Very likely," interrupted Murowski, "but that is more than I am."

"No, and I am not ready yet," said Edward van Rheijn.
