"Would the Kandjeng toean condescend to accept them at my hands?" asked
the Chinaman with his most winning smile.

"What? you wish me--?"

"Oh sir, it is but the merest trifle. The Kandjeng toean will have
the pleasure of smoking a really excellent cigar--I will answer for
it--and he will be conferring the greatest favour upon me if he will
accept them as a little present."

Without making any reply, without so much as a sign of consent, the
Resident listlessly allowed the gift to drop on a little table that
stood by his side, and, just as if nothing whatever had happened,
he took up the conversation precisely where it had been broken off.

"When that opium came ashore," said he, "did anyone happen to be
present?"

"No one, Kandjeng toean, but my two spies, Liem King and Than Khan."

"Can you trust the fellows?"

"Most absolutely," was the reply, "there is not the smallest fear
from that quarter."

"And the opium was discovered, you say, close to the spot where Ardjan
was picked up?"

"Not two hundred yards from where he was," replied the Chinaman.

"And they found the djoekoeng in which he came ashore did they
not?" asked van Gulpendam.

"Yes, Kandjeng toean, it was a surf boat."

"That is all I want to know, babah," said the Resident.

The astute Chinaman took the hint, he rose and was preparing to leave;
but the Resident motioned him back to his seat.

"You have not said a word yet, babah, about that other business,"
said van Gulpendam carelessly.

"What business?"

"Your son Lim Ho has treated Ardjan most barbarously."

"One has nothing but sorrow from one's children, Kandjeng toean,"
said the Chinaman piteously.

"That is all very fine," said the Resident, "but the chief medical
officer has made an official report which is very serious, very
serious indeed. I am afraid, I am afraid--"

"Ah, this is a world of suffering and woe, Kandjeng toean," sighed
Lim Yang Bing most dolefully. "Is there no possible means of squaring
it with the doctor?"
