Then the sun rose in his majesty and flooded everything in dazzling
radiance. At length Dalima felt that she could safely leave her
perch, and after giving another look round and observing the same
precautions she used in clambering up, she began to descend. As soon
as she reached the ground in safety, she stretched her numbed limbs,
then she took up her bundle, in which she fortunately found a couple
of parcels of rice. Swarms of ants were evidently anxious to share her
breakfast with her; but these she soon got rid of. A little stream
was murmuring close by, to this she hastened and bathed her face,
her feet, and her arms in the cool refreshing water. Thus, having
somewhat recovered from her painful night-watch, she sat down and
enjoyed her rice, and a draught from the clear brook. Then with fresh
courage and renewed strength, she continued her journey.

The whole of that day she plodded along patiently until she came to
a guard-house, where she heard the joyful news that the next dessa
she would come to was Karang Anjer.

"How far is it from here?" she asked.

The man looked puzzled; for your Javanese is not much of a hand at
judging distances. However, after a few moments' reflection, he told
her that she would have to pass about fifty telegraph poles.

Next day, with fresh courage she resumed her journey, and, after a
good half-hour's walking, she reached the dessa.

She lost no time in inquiring for the house of Mrs. Steenvlak and,
having found it, she sent in her name to the njonja, adding that she
was the baboe of nonna Anna. During her stay with the Steenvlaks, Anna
had often, very often, spoken about her faithful servant, and always in
terms of the greatest kindness and affection, so that Dalima found the
most cordial reception. But, as regards the main object of her long
journey, the poor baboe could get no information whatever. Prayers
and entreaties were alike in vain. To all her questions she could
obtain no other answer than, "I do not know."
