After the first excitement had somewhat abated, human infirmity began
to make itself felt. The wild pursuit of the game, the oppressive heat,
the painful clambering up and along the ravine wall, and last but
not least, the desperate hand to hand struggle, which followed this
exertion, had exhausted our two friends so utterly and so completely,
that they could no longer keep their feet, but flung themselves full
length upon the grass.

Thus they lay, panting and striving to recover their breath, when,
after the lapse of a few minutes, Grenits thought that in the bushes
close by he caught a glimpse of the last little pig that had escaped
the butchery. Without taking the trouble to rise, he slipped a
cartridge into his breech-loader, put his weapon to his shoulder and
fired in the direction where he had fancied he had seen the little
beast disappear in the bushes. The echo of the report reverberated
grandly through the ravine like a clap of thunder--on and on rolled
the stately sound, gradually growing fainter and fainter, until at
length it died away softly rumbling in the far distance.

But the sound had not quite passed away, when Grashuis, as if suddenly
moved by some spring, raised himself upon his elbow:

"Did you hear that?" asked he, in a tone almost of alarm.

"Hear what?" said Grenits, "the report of my rifle--Of course I
heard it."

"No, no," said the other, "I fancied I heard a human voice just
now! Listen."

Yes, yonder in the far distance, but yet audibly and distinctly was
heard the cry:

"Help! Help! Help!"

"By heaven!" cried Grenits, jumping up, "that's a woman's voice!"

"Help! help! toean!"

"A woman's voice," repeated Grashuis, "and crying out for help! Listen
again."

"Help! help! toean!"

"I can see no other toeans besides ourselves. Our comrades are far
away in the ravine--and the voice does not come from that direction
at all," continued Grashuis.

"But," said Grenits, as he looked all around, "I can see nothing
anywhere, Leendert!"
